,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, States patient has history of kidney stones",Pass,High,"The Past Medical History section explicitly lists 'History of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)'. This matches the checked detail, and kidney stones are not designated as a 'critical' detail here, so the detail is present and correctly categorized.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, States patient has anxiety",Pass,High,The Past Medical History section of the SOAP note explicitly lists 'Anxiety.' The check asks whether the patient has anxiety recorded in Past Medical History — that requirement is met and anxiety is not labeled as a critical detail here — so this is correct.,Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, States patient has chronic lower back pain",Pass,High,"The SOAP note's Past Medical History section explicitly lists 'Chronic low back pain.' This matches the check which asks whether the Past Medical History states the patient has chronic lower back pain. The detail is non-critical and is correctly categorized, so the check passes.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, States patient has osteoarthritis",Pass,High,"The Past Medical History section lists 'Degenerative joint disease/arthritis (knees, hands, shoulders)', which is synonymous with osteoarthritis. Therefore the SOAP note does state osteoarthritis in the Past Medical History.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Family History, N/A",Pass,High,"The check requested that the Family History be 'N/A'. The provided SOAP note contains a Family History section explicitly marked 'N/A'. This is not a critical detail and is correctly recorded, so the note meets the criterion.",Family History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, States that patient lives alone at home, but her children live close and willing to help",Pass,High,The SOAP note explicitly states in Social History and Safety/home setup that the patient 'lives alone at home' and that her 'daughter and son will alternate providing help initially (at least first 24 hours post-discharge)' / 'daughter and son providing assistance initially post-discharge.' This matches the checked detail.,Social History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, States before the injury patient would go bowling once a month and golf occasionally",Pass,High,"The Social History section explicitly states: 'recreational activities included gardening, monthly bowling, and occasional golf,' which matches the check ('bowling once a month and golf occasionally').

This detail is non-critical, and because it is present elsewhere in the note (even if not under Social History), per the instructions this counts as a pass.",Social History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Review of System, States Musculoskeletal: admits to shoulder pain",Pass,High,"The Review of Systems Musculoskeletal entry explicitly documents shoulder-related symptoms: 'Postoperative right shoulder with immobilizer' and 'left shoulder soreness from compensation.' The HPI and Assessment also note postoperative shoulder pain (3–4/10), so the ROS does admit to shoulder pain. Criterion is met.",Review of System
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Review of System, States Neurological: denies numbness or tingling in fingers",Pass,High,"The SOAP note's Review of Systems under Neurological states 'Denies numbness or tingling; no reported focal weakness.' The Subjective also notes 'No hand/finger swelling; no numbness or tingling.' This matches the check (denies numbness/tingling in fingers). The detail is present in the ROS Neurological section and is non-critical, so the check is correct.",Review of System
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In General Survey, N/A",Pass,High,"The check requests that 'General Survey' be documented as 'N/A'.

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Vitals, N/A",Pass,High,"The check requests that Vitals be listed as 'N/A'. In the SOAP note's Objective section, Vitals are explicitly documented as 'N/A'. This matches the requested detail and, as a non-critical recommendation, is acceptable.",Vitals
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Physical Exam, N/A",Pass,High,"The SOAP note's Objective section explicitly lists 'Physical Exam: - N/A'. The check asks that Physical Exam be 'N/A'. This is a non-critical documentation detail and it matches exactly, so the criterion is met.",Physical Exam

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Assessment, Aftercare following right shoulder replacement",Pass,High,The Assessment explicitly notes 'status post right total shoulder arthroplasty' and specifies aftercare-relevant instructions: the right upper extremity is non-weight-bearing and the sling is to be worn at all times except for exercises.

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered, N/A",Fail,High,"The check requested that the 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered' section contain 'N/A'. In the provided SOAP note, that Plan subsection instead lists active therapy and equipment orders (e.g., 'Continue daily inpatient therapy (OT/PT 7 days/week)', outpatient OT/PT referrals, evaluate/provide adaptive equipment, family assistance).

This matches the checked detail that the patient should continue to be careful during movement to minimize fall risk. The detail is non‑critical and is present, so the check is correct.",Patient education
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Patient education, States that patient should continue with exercise and activity as tolerated.",Pass,High,"The Patient education section instructs the patient to 'Perform prescribed pendulum and hand/finger exercises' and notes a 'gradual return to activity with therapy guidance,' along with continued OT/PT follow-up.

The Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section does not explicitly repeat this, but the check treats the section as a recommendation and the detail is not flagged as critical. Per the instructions, a non-critical detail present elsewhere but not in the specified subsection is a pass.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

The Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section lists outpatient OT/PT follow-up but does not explicitly state that the patient should inform the physical therapist about increased left shoulder pain. However, the Patient education section does state: 'Protect left shoulder from overuse; report increasing pain.' Because this detail is non-critical and the note does include an instruction to report increasing left shoulder pain (albeit under Patient education rather than the specified Follow up section), per the provided rule that non-critical items present but placed in a different section count as a pass, this meets the criterion.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

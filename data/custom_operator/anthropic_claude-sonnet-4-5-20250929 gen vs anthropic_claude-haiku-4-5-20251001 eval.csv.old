However, the location 'Bearden, Florida' is mentioned later in the Physical Exam section under Neurological findings: 'place (home in Bearden, Florida)'. Since the detail is present in the SOAP note but in an incorrect section (Physical Exam instead of Header), and location information is not a critical detail that would severely impact patient care or clinical decision-making, this would normally be considered a pass under the criteria.

However, the telehealth/video visit information is documented in the Header section ('States that visit is conducted via video with patient at home and provider at clinic'), and the worsening nature of insomnia is documented in the HPI section ('States that sleep issues have been getting worse recently'). The Chief Complaint is somewhat vague and could have been more specific by stating 'worsening insomnia' rather than just 'sleep issues.' Since this is a recommendation-level detail (not critical), and the essential information about the telehealth visit and worsening insomnia is present elsewhere in the Subjective section, this represents incomplete documentation in the Chief Complaint itself.

Both components of the required detail are present in the HPI section. The 20-year duration of sleep trouble is documented, and the recent worsening is also documented.

Looking at the HPI section of the SOAP note, I can find the following relevant statements: (1) 'States that patient wakes up every night to use the bathroom and has been experiencing nocturia for decades.' (2) 'States that after nighttime awakening, patient is often unable to fall back asleep, sometimes remaining awake for 1-3 hours.' These statements directly match the details specified in the CHECK.

Examining the HPI section, I find the following relevant statements: 'States that after nighttime awakening, patient is often unable to fall back asleep, sometimes remaining awake for 1-3 hours' and 'States that patient sometimes gives up and gets up for the day at 4-5 AM'. The SOAP note documents that the patient stays awake for 1-3 hours (which encompasses the 2-3 hour range mentioned in the check) and gets up around 4-5 AM. While the wording is slightly different and the detail is presented across two separate statements rather than as one combined statement, the essential clinical information specified in the CHECK is present in the HPI. This is not a critical detail (it's a descriptive aspect of the sleep disturbance, not an allergy, substance use history, or other safety-critical information), so presence with minor variations in phrasing and organization constitutes a pass.",HPI

Looking through the HPI section, I can find detailed information about melatonin, ZzzQuil, trazodone, and the patient's sleep hygiene routine. However, there is NO statement in the HPI that explicitly says the magnesium supplement has had no noticeable effect on her insomnia. The magnesium is mentioned in the Medications section where it states 'States that patient currently takes magnesium glycinate 200 mg by mouth daily for muscle relaxation/sleep,' but there is no assessment of its effectiveness or lack thereof in the HPI. Additionally, in the Plan section under patient education, it states 'States that patient was counseled to continue magnesium glycinate as it is not causing problems and may provide benefit for muscle relaxation,' which suggests potential benefit rather than no effect. The detail specified in the check is not present in the HPI as stated.",HPI

Looking through the HPI section, I can find: (1) States that patient has a history of hypertension diagnosed in October 2017 (listed in Past Medical History, not HPI). However, in the HPI section itself, there is NO mention of blood pressure medications or the absence thereof. The HPI discusses sleep issues, melatonin, ZzzQuil, trazodone, nocturia, surgical menopause, and anxiety - but does not address whether the patient is or is not taking blood pressure medications. While the patient's hypertension history is documented in the Past Medical History section, the specific detail about NOT currently taking blood pressure medications despite having hypertension is not stated anywhere in the HPI. This is a non-critical detail (it's a medication management issue, not an allergy or substance use history), but since it is not present in the HPI at all, the check fails.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient was prescribed trazodone and also tried ZzzQuil in the past for insomnia with no improvement that she can remember.",Pass,Low,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the patient was prescribed trazodone and also tried ZzzQuil in the past for insomnia with no improvement that she can remember. Examining the HPI section: (1) Trazodone is mentioned: 'States that patient took trazodone approximately 5 years ago prescribed by previous doctor but stopped taking it and cannot recall reason or effectiveness.' (2) ZzzQuil is mentioned: 'States that patient uses ZzzQuil sparingly, approximately 1-2 times per month at half dose when desperate.' However, the CHECK specifies these should be documented as past attempts with 'no improvement that she can remember.' The note states the patient 'cannot recall reason or effectiveness' for trazodone (which implies unclear effectiveness) and uses ZzzQuil currently (not clearly stated as a past trial with no improvement). The phrasing in the actual note is slightly different - it doesn't explicitly state 'no improvement' for either medication in the way the CHECK describes. Additionally, ZzzQuil is described as current use ('uses...sparingly') rather than a past trial. While the medications are mentioned in the HPI, the specific characterization of 'tried...with no improvement that she can remember' is not precisely stated. Since this is a non-critical detail (medication trial history is important but not critical like allergies or substance use categorization), and the information is present in the HPI albeit with slightly different wording, this would be considered a pass under the criterion that non-critical details present but slightly differently characterized still meet the requirement.",HPI

Examining the HPI, I can confirm that the note states: 'States that patient underwent surgical menopause approximately 20 years ago with bilateral oophorectomy.' This detail is present in the HPI section as required. While surgical menopause is also mentioned in other sections (Surgical history/hospitalizations, Past Medical History, Assessment, and Review of Systems - Endocrine), the critical question is whether it appears in the HPI, and it does. The detail is correctly categorized in the HPI where it belongs as part of the patient's history of present illness. This is not a critical detail in the sense of patient safety (like allergies or substance use), but rather a relevant historical detail that contextualizes the patient's current presentation. The detail is present and appropriately placed.",HPI

States that patient experienced hot flashes for 6-8 months post-surgery but has not had vasomotor symptoms in years.' This detail is present in the HPI section exactly as specified in the check. The information about hot flashes for 6-8 months post-surgery is correctly documented in the HPI. This is not a critical detail (it's historical context about menopausal symptoms, not an allergy or substance use that would severely impact patient care), so even if it were miscategorized, it would pass.

Examining the HPI section, I find the following relevant statement: 'States that patient inquired about progesterone therapy after two friends reported benefit for their sleep issues.' This statement is present in the HPI and accurately captures the detail specified in the check. The information is correctly categorized under the HPI (History of Present Illness) section, which is the appropriate location for discussing the patient's chief complaint and related concerns, including what prompted the inquiry about a potential treatment. This is not a critical detail (it does not involve allergies, substance use, or other safety-critical information), so even if it were miscategorized, it would still pass.

Examining the HPI section of the SOAP note, I find no mention of the sleep study appointment. The HPI focuses on the patient's sleep history, symptoms, medications, and sleep hygiene practices. However, the sleep study appointment information IS present in the SOAP note, but it appears in the PLAN section under 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered,' not in the HPI section. Since the CHECK specifically asks for this detail to be in the HPI, and it is currently located in the PLAN section, this is an incorrect categorization. However, the criterion states that if a detail is not critical and is present but incorrectly categorized, it is a pass. The sleep study appointment location is not a critical detail in the sense defined (it would not severely impact patient care if it were in the Plan rather than HPI). Therefore, this should be considered a pass since the information is present in the note, just in a different section. However, re-reading the CHECK more carefully: it specifically asks 'In HPI' - meaning the detail must be IN the HPI section. The detail is NOT in the HPI section; it is only in the Plan section. This is an incorrect answer to the specific CHECK as stated.",HPI

Looking at the Medications section of the SOAP note, I can find: 'States that patient currently takes melatonin supplement that contains L-theanine for relaxation.' The note also states: 'States that patient takes melatonin 3 mg approximately one hour before bed (around 9 PM).' However, the note does not explicitly state 'nightly' in the Medications section, though it is implied throughout the document and stated in the HPI section. More importantly, the Medications section lists these as separate statements rather than combining them into one complete statement that specifies 'OTC Melatonin with L-Theanine 3 mg 1 hour before bed nightly.' The information is present and correctly categorized in the Medications section, but it is fragmented across multiple statements rather than presented as a single consolidated medication entry with all the specified details (OTC status, L-Theanine inclusion, 3 mg dose, 1 hour before bed, and nightly frequency). Since this is not a critical detail (it's a non-prescription supplement, not an allergy or controlled substance), and the information is present and correctly categorized even if not perfectly consolidated, this would be considered a pass.",Medications

Looking at the Medications section of the SOAP note, there is a specific statement: 'States that patient currently takes Centrum Silver 50+ for women (multivitamin with calcium and vitamin D) by mouth daily for general health and bone health.' This statement clearly indicates that the patient is currently taking this OTC multivitamin daily. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Medications section. This is not a critical detail (it's a standard multivitamin, not an allergy or substance use issue), so correct categorization is a recommendation rather than a requirement.

Looking at the Medications section of the SOAP note, there is indeed a statement: 'States that patient uses ZzzQuil as needed, approximately 1-2 times per month at half the recommended dose for sleep.' This detail is present and correctly categorized in the Medications section. While ZzzQuil is an over-the-counter sleep aid that the patient uses occasionally rather than a prescription medication, it is appropriately documented in the Medications section as it is a substance the patient takes for therapeutic purposes. The detail is accurate and in the correct location.

This statement clearly indicates that the patient is currently taking magnesium glycinate 200 mg daily. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Medications section. Additionally, this detail is also reinforced in the Plan section under patient education where it states: 'States that patient was counseled to continue magnesium glycinate as it is not causing problems and may provide benefit for muscle relaxation.' The medication information is accurate and appropriately placed in the Medications category.

Looking at the SOAP note's Medications section, I find: 'States that trazodone for sleep was discontinued approximately 5 years ago.' However, this entry does NOT include the detail that the patient 'cannot remember why she discontinued it.' That specific detail about not recalling the reason for discontinuation is present in the Subjective/HPI section: 'States that patient took trazodone approximately 5 years ago prescribed by previous doctor but stopped taking it and cannot recall reason or effectiveness.' While the information is present in the note, it is not in the Medications section where the CHECK specifies it should be. Since this is a medication history detail (not a critical safety issue like an allergy or active substance use that could impact immediate patient care), this would be considered a non-critical detail that is present but incorrectly categorized.

This matches the CHECK requirement - the detail is present and correctly categorized in the Surgical history/hospitalizations section. The terminology used is 'excision' rather than 'removal,' but these are clinically equivalent terms for the same procedure. The date (April 2022) and procedure (basal cell carcinoma treatment) are accurate.

This directly matches the requirement in the CHECK. The detail is present and correctly categorized under Past Medical History, which is the appropriate location for this information.

This accurately captures that the patient has arthritis with the knees being particularly affected (the worst). The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Past Medical History section. While the wording is slightly different ('particularly bilateral knees' vs 'knees being the worst'), the meaning is equivalent and the clinical information is accurately conveyed.

This detail IS present in the Past Medical History section. While the wording differs slightly (the note says 'abnormal heart sounds' rather than 'arrhythmia'), the clinical meaning is essentially the same - an abnormal cardiac finding was noted and evaluated and found to be benign.

The note does affirm fatigue and sleep disturbance (difficulty sleeping). However, the vasomotor symptoms denial is located in the Endocrine section, not the Constitutional/General section. The Endocrine section states: 'Denies heat/cold intolerance, polyuria, or polydipsia. History of surgical menopause without current vasomotor symptoms.' While the information about denying vasomotor symptoms is present in the note, it is categorized under Endocrine rather than General/Constitutional as specified in the CHECK. Since this is not a critical detail (vasomotor symptoms are appropriately placed in the Endocrine section where they belong), and the fatigue/sleep disturbance is correctly documented in Constitutional, this would typically be a pass.

However, the SOAP note does NOT include any statement about the patient being 'well-nourished.' The Physical Exam section states 'General appearance is normal' but does not specifically address nutritional status. Since 'well-nourished' is a standard component of a general survey and its absence represents missing documentation rather than incorrect categorization, and this is not a critical detail that would severely impact patient care (it's a descriptive finding that doesn't change management), this would typically be considered a minor omission.

The respiratory examination finding is appropriately placed in the Physical Exam section, which is the correct location for objective physical examination findings. This is not a critical detail (it's a normal respiratory exam finding, not an allergy or substance use issue), but it is correctly categorized in the proper section.

No focal neurological deficits noted. Judgment appears intact.' The required information is present in the Physical Exam section under Neurological. While the wording is slightly expanded with specific details (person/place/time specifics and mention of judgment), the core elements requested are all there: 'mental status at baseline,' 'fully alert and oriented,' and 'no focal neurological deficits noted.' This is not a critical detail (it's a standard neurological assessment finding that doesn't impact patient safety if slightly reformatted), and the information is present and correctly categorized in the Physical Exam section.

Additionally, under 'Neurological,' it states 'Judgment appears intact.' The required elements are all present: (1) mood and affect appear normal ✓, (2) behavior is appropriate ✓ (stated in General section), (3) judgment intact ✓, and (4) thought content organized ✓. While the exact wording differs slightly (e.g., 'organized and coherent' vs 'seems organized'), the substance and meaning are identical.

The detail about arthritis/baseline arthritis symptoms is present in the note but is NOT documented in the Physical Exam section where the check specifies it should be. Since arthritis findings in the physical exam are not critical details that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized (unlike allergies or substance use), this would normally be a pass if the information were present but miscategorized. However, the information is completely absent from the Physical Exam section - it is not present there at all. The check specifically requires the statement to be 'In Physical Exam' and it is not there.",Physical Exam

Looking at the SOAP note, under the Objective section, there is a subsection labeled 'Labs/Diagnostics:' followed by 'N/A'. However, this is factually incorrect based on the content of the Plan section, which clearly states that 'polysomnography (sleep study) scheduled for Monday, September 30, 2024' is being ordered. Additionally, the Plan section explicitly states 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered:' with specific tests listed. Since labs/diagnostics are being ordered as part of the plan, the Objective section should not show 'N/A' for Labs/Diagnostics - this is a documentation error. The check is asking if N/A is present in Labs/Diagnostics under Objective, and while it technically is present in the note as written, this represents an incorrect categorization. The detail about ordered testing exists in the Plan but is missing from the Objective Labs/Diagnostics section where it should be documented. This is not a critical error in terms of patient safety (the tests are documented in the Plan), but it is an organizational/documentation error. Since the check is asking whether N/A appears in Labs/Diagnostics in the Objective section, and it does appear there, the literal answer to the check is that yes, N/A is present.

This clearly documents insomnia in the Assessment section. While it is specifically documented as 'Chronic insomnia' rather than simply 'Insomnia,' the detail is present and correctly categorized in the Assessment section.

Since this is a medication continuation instruction (not a critical detail like an allergy or substance use that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized), and the detail IS present in the note but in a different section, this meets the criterion for a pass. The instruction about continuing melatonin is appropriately placed in Patient education rather than Labs/diagnostics/imaging, which is the correct categorization.

Looking at the Patient education section in the SOAP note:
1. 'States that patient was advised to continue current sleep hygiene routine including consistent 10 PM bedtime, cool room temperature, and no TV in bedroom.' - This matches the first part of the CHECK.
2. 'States that patient was advised that after sleep study results, better as-needed medication options for difficult nights can be discussed.' AND 'States that patient was advised that different sleep medications work better for different types of sleep problems and medication decisions will be guided by sleep study findings.' - These statements indicate that medication changes/decisions will be discussed after sleep study results are reviewed, which matches the second part of the CHECK.

Looking at the Patient education section in the SOAP note, I find the following statement: 'States that patient was advised that white noise or nature sounds may be helpful to mask disruptive noises.' This statement conveys the same clinical advice - that white noise (and nature sounds) may be helpful. While the exact wording differs slightly (the note says 'white noise or nature sounds may be helpful' rather than 'could try a white noise machine or sleep application'), the substance and intent of the advice is present. The patient was indeed advised about white noise as a potential sleep aid. This is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation for sleep hygiene, not a safety issue like allergies or substance use), so even if there were minor wording differences, the presence of this advice in the Patient education section means the criterion is met.",Patient education

Examining the SOAP note's 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments' section, I find: 'States that patient is to await contact regarding CBT-I referral scheduling after provider follows up with sleep medicine clinic.' This indicates the patient will await contact about CBT-I referral scheduling, which implies a referral is being pursued and follow-up will occur. Additionally, in the Plan section under 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered,' it states: 'States that provider will follow up today with sleep medicine clinic to check on status of CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) referral.' While this detail appears in the Plan section rather than the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section, the information about the CBT-I referral and follow-up is present in the note. The detail is present but located in a different subsection (Plan) rather than strictly under Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments.

Examining the SOAP note's 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments' section:
- It states 'patient is to continue follow up with primary care provider for coordination of care regarding hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nocturia evaluation, and overall health management.'
- It states 'provider will coordinate care with patient's primary care provider regarding comprehensive management of chronic insomnia, anxiety, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and nocturia evaluation' (in the Plan section under Labs/diagnostics).

1. Patient encouraged to follow up with PCP for hypertension and nocturia - PRESENT (stated as 'continue follow up with primary care provider for coordination of care regarding hypertension...nocturia evaluation')
2. Report will be copied to primary care once established - NOT PRESENT in the document

The detail about establishing care with a new primary care physician is actually documented in the HPI section: 'States that this is patient's first visit with Dr. Flores as her new primary care physician.' While this information is present in the note, it is categorized under HPI rather than Chief Complaint. However, this is not a critical detail in the sense defined in the prompt. A critical detail would be one where miscategorization severely impacts patient care (such as allergies or substance use). The reason for the visit being documented as 'well visit/checkup' versus 'establish care with new PCP' is a matter of documentation style and specificity, not patient safety.

While the detail about having no specific complaints is present in the note, it is documented in the HPI section rather than in the Chief Complaint(s) section itself. However, this is not a critical detail—it does not impact patient safety or clinical decision-making in a severe way. The absence of complaints at a well visit is a routine finding that is appropriately captured in the HPI.

The HPI does not mention that the patient is currently seeing an oncologist for soft tissue sarcoma treatment. However, this information IS present in the SOAP note in multiple other locations: (1) in the Medications section stating 'pazopanib...for soft tissue sarcoma', (2) in the Past Medical History section stating 'soft tissue sarcoma (currently being managed by oncologist)', and (3) in the Assessment section stating 'Soft tissue sarcoma, currently under oncology management on pazopanib therapy', and (4) in the Plan section stating 'coordination of care with patient's oncologist regarding soft tissue sarcoma management.' While this is an important clinical detail about the patient's current cancer treatment, it is not critical in the sense defined by the prompt (it would not hinder patient care if miscategorized, as it is documented elsewhere in the note and the patient is actively coordinating with oncology). The detail should ideally be in the HPI as it is relevant context for the visit, but since it appears correctly documented in other appropriate sections (PMH, Assessment, Plan), and the criterion specifically asks if it is in the HPI, the answer is that this detail is missing from the HPI where it should be present.",HPI

While this detail is present in the SOAP note, it is incorrectly categorized - it appears in the Assessment and Plan sections rather than in the HPI where the check specifies it should be. Since hypertension management details are not critical information that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized (unlike allergies or substance use), and the information is present elsewhere in the note, this would typically be considered a pass.

The HPI only mentions 'no particular complaints' in general terms. The specific negation of cancer-related symptoms and heart attack symptoms is not explicitly documented in the HPI section, though these details are present elsewhere in the note (cardiovascular symptoms denied in ROS, and soft tissue sarcoma is noted as being managed). Since this is a recommendation-level detail (not critical), and the information is present in the note but not specifically in the HPI as checked, this would technically be an incorrect categorization for the HPI specifically. However, the substance of the information (no current concerning symptoms) is documented. Given the strict interpretation of the check asking for this detail 'In HPI,' and it is not explicitly stated there, this is incorrect.",HPI

The information about Claritin management is documented in the Medications section: 'States that patient currently takes Claritin (dosage and frequency not specified) for common allergies.' While the detail about seasonal allergies and Claritin management is present in the note, it is not in the Allergies/Intolerance section where it should be. However, this is not a critical detail in the sense defined by the prompt. A critical detail would be one where miscategorization severely impacts patient care (like missing an allergy entirely or misplacing a true allergy). Here, the allergy information is present and accessible in the Medications section, and the Allergies/Intolerance section does document that the patient has environmental/seasonal allergies. The specific medication management detail being in Medications rather than Allergies/Intolerance is a categorization issue but not a critical one that would hinder patient care.

The medication is present in the correct section (Medications), and it is being taken for cold-related symptoms (recurrent colds/common cold symptoms). While the phrasing differs slightly between 'recurrent colds' in the note and 'common cold symptoms' in the check, these refer to the same clinical indication. This is not a critical detail (it's a medication indication, not an allergy or substance use history), so even if there were minor categorization issues, it would still pass.

The Social History states: 'States that patient admits marijuana use - smoked weed in university, continues to use occasionally, prescribed, as part of treatment.' While marijuana use is present in the note and is correctly identified as prescribed/part of treatment, it is categorized under Social History rather than Medications. Since substance use history is identified as a critical detail that needs to be categorized correctly, and this detail has been placed in the wrong section (Social History instead of Medications), this is an incorrect categorization of a critical detail.

This detail is present in the correct category (Medications). While the wording is slightly different ('aches and pains' vs 'pain'), the substance and meaning are identical - Advil is documented as an as-needed medication for pain-related symptoms.

The note also documents in Surgical history/hospitalizations that 'patient had a heart attack in the past (timing not specified beyond ""in the past"")' and in the Cardiovascular ROS 'Denies current chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, or peripheral edema.' The myocardial infarction is correctly placed in the Past Medical History section. The timing is unspecified (documented as 'in the past'), and the patient is currently managed without acute symptoms (denies current chest pain and related cardiac symptoms). While the note doesn't explicitly state 'managed without symptoms,' the clinical documentation supports this interpretation through the absence of current cardiac complaints and the patient's stable presentation.

However, the low sodium diet IS mentioned in the Assessment section under 'Hyperlipidemia, currently managed with lifestyle modifications (low sodium diet)' and again in the Plan section under patient education where it states 'patient was counseled on continuing lifestyle interventions including low sodium diet.' Since the detail about the low sodium diet is present in the note but located in the Assessment and Plan sections rather than in Social History, and since this is not a critical detail (it's a dietary recommendation/lifestyle modification rather than something that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized), this would normally be considered a pass. However, the check specifically asks if this detail is 'In Social History,' and it is definitively NOT in that section—it's in Assessment and Plan.

The information about intense workouts is present in Social History, though it's described as 'daily high-intensity workouts' rather than specifically 'in his spare time' - the workouts are mentioned separately from the spare time activities (world-building and letterbox games). Additionally, the patient is female (Mary Smith Gonzales, 54-year-old female), not male as suggested by 'his' in the check. However, the core detail about intense/high-intensity workouts is documented in the Social History section.

The note mentions letterbox games correctly, but it describes the computer gaming activity as 'world-building (computer-based fantasy world creation)' rather than specifically 'Minecraft.' However, world-building in a computer-based fantasy context is reasonably consistent with Minecraft gameplay. More importantly, this is a non-critical detail about recreational activities and hobbies. Even if there is a minor discrepancy in how the gaming is described (world-building vs. Minecraft specifically), the detail is present in the correct Social History category.

This means the patient is NEGATIVE for fatigue, not POSITIVE for fatigue as specified in the CHECK. The note clearly documents that fatigue is denied (negative), which contradicts the requirement for fatigue to be positive. This is an incorrect categorization of the fatigue finding. Since this is not a critical detail (fatigue in ROS is a recommendation-level finding, not something that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized), a detail that is present but incorrectly categorized would normally pass.

Examining the SOAP note's Review of System section:

1. General/Constitutional: The note states 'Denies fever, chills, fatigue, or unintentional weight changes.' This effectively documents no acute symptoms.

2. ENT (Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat): The note states 'Reports common allergies; reports occasional toothaches; denies visual disturbances, hearing loss, or epistaxis.'

3. Respiratory: The note states 'Reports recurrent colds.'

The CHECK specifies that seasonal allergies and frequent colds should both be under 'ENT'. However, in the SOAP note, while seasonal allergies are documented under HEENT, the recurrent colds are documented under the separate 'Respiratory' category, not under ENT/HEENT.

This is a categorization issue. The detail about recurrent colds is present in the note but is placed in the Respiratory section rather than the ENT section as specified in the CHECK. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a symptom that doesn't severely impact patient care if slightly miscategorized between related systems), this would normally be considered a pass per the instructions.

However, the CHECK is very specific about where these details should appear together under 'ENT'. The seasonal allergies ARE correctly placed under HEENT, but the frequent colds are NOT under ENT—they are under Respiratory instead.

While the pronoun in the check differs from the patient's actual gender, the core educational recommendation about STD testing when becoming sexually active with new partners is accurately documented in the appropriate section. This is not a critical detail (it's a preventive health recommendation, not a safety-critical item like allergies or substance use history), so even if there were minor wording differences, the presence of the detail in the correct category would constitute a pass.",Patient education

This detail is clearly present in the Patient education section and accurately categorized. The note explicitly mentions continuing diet (low sodium diet) and lifestyle remedies (regular exercise) for hypertension management.

This detail is present in the Patient education section and accurately reflects the clinical reasoning about aging, estrogen decline, and bone health. The substance (strength/weight training recommendation) is there, the rationale (aging, estrogen loss, bone loss/osteoporosis prevention) is there, and it is correctly categorized under Patient education.

Looking at the Header section in the Subjective portion of the SOAP note, it states: 'States that provider is Dr. Thompson from the orthopedic rehabilitation team.' This directly confirms that the provider name Dr. Thompson is mentioned in the Header. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Header section as required. This is a straightforward factual verification with no ambiguity.",Header
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Chief Complaint(s), States patient following up for orthopedic rehabilitation evaluation following a right total shoulder arthroplasty",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the Chief Complaint(s) section states that the patient is following up for orthopedic rehabilitation evaluation following a right total shoulder arthroplasty. Looking at the SOAP note's Chief Complaint(s) section, it states: 'States that patient is present for post-operative rehabilitation following right total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).' This matches the required detail. The phrasing is slightly different ('post-operative rehabilitation' vs 'orthopedic rehabilitation evaluation'), but the essential information is present and accurate - the patient is indeed following up for rehabilitation after right total shoulder arthroplasty. This is not a critical detail that would impact patient safety or care if slightly rephrased. The core clinical information is correctly captured in the appropriate section.",Chief Complaint(s)
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient is a 79 year old female.",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient is a 79-year-old female. Examining the HPI section of the SOAP note, the first line clearly states: 'States that patient is a 79-year-old female.' This detail is present and correctly categorized in the HPI section. While this demographic information could arguably belong in the Header section (where it is also mentioned), the criterion only requires that it be stated in the HPI, which it is. The detail is present and in the appropriate location. This is not a critical detail that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized, but it is correctly placed regardless.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient DOB is 11/6/1937.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the patient's DOB (11/6/1937) is stated in the HPI section. Looking at the SOAP note, the DOB is mentioned in the Header under Subjective ('States that patient is a 79-year-old female, DOB November 6, 1937') and again in the HPI section ('States that patient is a 79-year-old female'). However, the specific DOB date is NOT explicitly stated in the HPI section itself - only the age is mentioned. The DOB appears in the Header but not in the HPI paragraph. Since this is not a critical detail (DOB is appropriately placed in the Header/demographics section where it belongs), and the check specifically asks if it's in the HPI, this is technically incorrect placement. However, the information is present in the note. Given that DOB is not a critical detail that would be dangerous if miscategorized (unlike allergies or substance use), and the detail IS present in the document albeit in a different section, this would normally be a pass. But the check is very specific: 'In HPI, States that patient DOB is 11/6/1937.' The DOB is not stated in the HPI section - it's only stated in the Header. Therefore, this check is not met.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient was referred by Dr. Debernardis.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient was referred by Dr. Debernardis. Looking at the HPI section, it does not mention Dr. Debernardis or any referral. The HPI discusses the patient's post-operative status, pain level, functional limitations, activities of daily living struggles, assessment scores, restrictions, exercises, family support, home environment, and concerns about recovery. However, the information about Dr. Debernardis being the referring physician appears in the 'Surgical history/hospitalizations' section, not in the HPI section. The check specifies the detail should be 'In HPI,' and while the detail is present in the note, it is categorized in the wrong section. Since this is not a critical detail (it does not impact patient safety or clinical decision-making in the way allergies or substance use would), this would normally be a pass. However, the check is specifically asking if this detail appears IN the HPI section, and it does not—it appears in Surgical history/hospitalizations instead. Therefore, the answer is incorrect as stated in the HPI.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient’s right shoulder pain has been manageable, but use of the right arm for daily activities continues to be difficult",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that 'patient's right shoulder pain has been manageable, but use of the right arm for daily activities continues to be difficult.' Looking at the HPI section, I find: (1) 'States that patient is experiencing manageable pain (3-4/10)' - this confirms manageable pain; (2) 'States that patient is unable to use right arm at all' and 'States that patient is significantly struggling with activities of daily living including dressing...bathing...and general self-care tasks.' This confirms difficulty with daily activities. However, the HPI states the patient is 'unable to use right arm at all' rather than just that it 'continues to be difficult.' The substance and meaning are present - the patient has manageable pain but cannot use the arm for daily activities due to immobilization and post-operative restrictions. This detail is present in the HPI and accurately reflects the clinical situation described. The detail is not critical (it's not an allergy or substance use history that could be dangerously miscategorized), and it is correctly placed in the HPI section where it belongs. The information is present and appropriately categorized.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient has been having trouble with activities of daily living, including putting on shirts and pulling up pants, which is increasingly difficult due to prior back pain",Fail,Low,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI contains information about the patient having trouble with activities of daily living, specifically mentioning putting on shirts and pulling up pants, which is increasingly difficult due to prior back pain. Examining the HPI section, I find extensive documentation of ADL difficulties: 'States that patient is significantly struggling with activities of daily living including dressing (requires moderate help with upper body dressing and some help with lower body dressing), bathing (requires assistance due to fall risk), and general self-care tasks.' The note also states 'States that patient was completely independent with all activities of daily living prior to surgery including dressing, bathing, cooking, and cleaning, though tasks took longer due to arthritis and back pain.' However, the specific details mentioned in the CHECK—'putting on shirts and pulling up pants'—are not explicitly stated in the HPI. The HPI mentions general 'dressing' difficulties and upper/lower body dressing assistance needs, but does not specifically call out shirts and pants. Additionally, while back pain is mentioned as a historical factor that made tasks take longer pre-operatively, the current ADL difficulties are attributed to the shoulder immobilization post-operatively, not the back pain. The CHECK specifies that the difficulty is 'increasingly difficult due to prior back pain,' but the note attributes current ADL struggles primarily to the shoulder surgery and immobilization. This is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation-level categorization issue), but the specific details requested in the CHECK are not present in the HPI as written.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports daughter has been helping her with dressing.",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports her daughter has been helping her with dressing. Looking at the HPI section, I can find the following relevant statement: 'States that patient is significantly struggling with activities of daily living including dressing (requires moderate help with upper body dressing and some help with lower body dressing), bathing (requires assistance due to fall risk), and general self-care tasks.' Additionally, later in the HPI it states: 'States that patient is accompanied by daughter who has been providing assistance and made home safety modifications; son also available to help.' The HPI clearly documents that the daughter has been providing assistance with activities of daily living, which includes dressing. The detail is present in the HPI section where it should be. This is not a critical detail (it's a functional/social detail rather than something like an allergy or substance use that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized). The information is correctly placed in the HPI.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient has partial dentures and wears glasses",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient has partial dentures and wears glasses. Examining the HPI section, I find that it does NOT contain information about partial dentures or glasses. However, both of these details ARE present in the SOAP note, but they are documented in the Past Medical History section and the Physical Exam section under HEENT, not in the HPI section. Since the check specifies 'In HPI' and these details are not located in the HPI section, the criterion is not met. While this is not a critical detail (misplacing glasses or denture information would not severely impact patient care), the check specifically requires these details to be in the HPI, and they are absent from that section.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports having three endoscopies this year due to history of ulcers and bleeding.",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports having three endoscopies this year due to history of ulcers and bleeding. Looking at the HPI section, I can see it does NOT contain this information. The HPI focuses on the patient's post-operative shoulder arthroplasty recovery, functional limitations, pain management, and rehabilitation needs. However, the information about three endoscopies is present in the SOAP note, but it is located in the 'Surgical history/hospitalizations' section, not in the HPI section. The CHECK specifically asks if this detail is in the HPI. Since this detail is not present in the HPI (even though it is present elsewhere in the note), the CHECK criterion is not met. This is not a critical categorization issue since the information is documented in an appropriate section (surgical history), but the CHECK is asking for a specific location (HPI) where it does not appear.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports having most recent colonoscopy on July 20th.",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports having the most recent colonoscopy on July 20th. Looking at the HPI section, I can find the following relevant statement: 'States that patient underwent three upper endoscopies in current year: May 12, May 31, and July 20 for evaluation of history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal bleeding. States that patient underwent colonoscopy on July 20 (same day as third endoscopy).' The HPI does indeed state that the patient had a colonoscopy on July 20th. This is a non-critical detail (it's a historical procedure date, not an allergy or substance use that would severely impact immediate patient care), and it is present in the HPI section where it should be. Therefore, the criterion is met.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States prior to surgery patient was independent in all activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, cooking and cleaning",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that prior to surgery the patient was independent in all activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, cooking and cleaning. Looking at the HPI section, I find the following relevant statement: 'States that patient was completely independent with all activities of daily living prior to surgery including dressing, bathing, cooking, and cleaning, though tasks took longer due to arthritis and back pain.' This statement is present in the HPI and contains all the required details: (1) prior to surgery, (2) independent in all activities of daily living, (3) specifically mentions bathing, dressing, cooking, and cleaning. The detail is correctly categorized in the HPI section where it belongs. This is not a critical detail that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized—it is contextual information about the patient's baseline functional status. The criterion is met completely and accurately.",HPI

Examining the HPI section, I can find the following relevant statement: 'States that patient is wearing a shoulder immobilizer/sling at all times.' This detail is clearly present in the HPI section. The shoulder immobilizer is a critical detail for post-operative shoulder arthroplasty care and is appropriately categorized in the HPI where it describes the patient's current clinical status and management. The detail is both present and correctly placed.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports she is fatigued easier following procedure.",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports she is fatigued easier following the procedure. Looking at the HPI section, I can find the following relevant statement: 'States that patient reports fatigue with minimal activity and concerns about balance, especially with one arm immobilized.' This statement is present in the HPI and indicates that the patient reports fatigue post-operatively. Additionally, in the Review of Systems under Constitutional, it states: 'Reports fatigue and decreased endurance.' The HPI clearly documents that the patient is experiencing fatigue following the procedure. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the HPI section. While the wording is slightly different from the exact phrasing in the check ('fatigue with minimal activity' rather than 'fatigued easier'), the meaning is equivalent and the information is clearly documented in the HPI as required.",HPI

Additionally, the HPI states: 'States that patient has decreased strength, range of motion, balance, and endurance post-operatively.' The HPI also mentions: 'States that patient is wearing a shoulder immobilizer/sling at all times.' However, the specific detail requested—that the patient reports decreased balance 'especially with use of sling'—is not explicitly stated in the HPI. The note mentions concerns about balance with one arm immobilized and mentions the sling separately, but does not specifically connect the decreased balance to the use of the sling in the HPI section. This detail is not critical (it's a clinical observation rather than an allergy or substance use history), so if it were present but miscategorized, it would pass. However, the specific phrasing requested is not present in the HPI.",HPI

Looking at the HPI section, I can find: (1) 'States that patient is significantly struggling with activities of daily living including dressing (requires moderate help with upper body dressing and some help with lower body dressing), bathing (requires assistance due to fall risk)' - this indicates the patient needs assistance with bathing due to fall risk, but does not explicitly state the patient is 'afraid to bathe because she might fall.' (2) 'States that patient is performing prescribed exercises including pendulum movements and ball squeezing but reports anxiety about performing them' - this states the patient reports anxiety about performing the exercises, but does not explicitly state she is 'scared to do pendulum and squeezing a ball exercises.' While the HPI conveys related information about fall concerns and anxiety about exercises, it does not contain the specific detail as stated in the CHECK. The CHECK specifies a particular phrasing about being 'afraid to bathe because she might fall' and being 'scared to do' the exercises. The HPI uses different language: 'requires assistance due to fall risk' and 'reports anxiety about performing them.' Since this is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation-level detail about patient psychology/fears), and the substance/concept is present but not explicitly stated in the exact way specified, this would typically be considered a pass. However, the CHECK is asking if the patient 'states' these specific fears, and the HPI does not contain explicit statements of these fears in the way described.",HPI

Looking at the HPI section, I can find: 'States that patient is accompanied by daughter who has been providing assistance and made home safety modifications; son also available to help.' However, the specific detail about the son installing a grab bar in the shower this weekend is NOT in the HPI section. Instead, this detail appears in the Plan section under 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments': 'States that son is to install grab bar in shower this weekend.' Additionally, the information about the daughter helping with showering is mentioned in the HPI as 'bathing (requires assistance due to fall risk)' but does not explicitly state the daughter helps her shower. The specific detail about the son installing the grab bar this weekend is located in the Plan section, not in the HPI section as the CHECK specifies. Since the CHECK is asking for this detail to be in the HPI specifically, and it is actually in the Plan section, this is an incorrect categorization. However, this is not a critical detail (it's a logistical/planning matter, not something that would severely impact patient care or clinical decision-making).

The pill organizer is mentioned, but it appears in the 'Medications' section under the Subjective heading, not in the HPI. The Medications section states: 'States that patient's daughter has organized medications in weekly pill organizer due to difficulty opening bottles with one hand.' Since the check specifies the detail should be 'In HPI' and it is actually located in the Medications subsection instead, this is an incorrect categorization. However, this is not a critical detail—it's a recommendation about where this information should appear. The detail IS present in the note, just in a different section.

However, there is NO specific statement in the HPI that the patient reports having a hard time cleaning her dentures properly. While denture-related information is present in the SOAP note (in the Medications section where it mentions 'denture adhesive for partial dentures' and in the Past Medical History where it states 'patient wears partial dentures'), this specific detail about difficulty cleaning dentures is not documented in the HPI section. Since the CHECK specifically requires this detail to be in the HPI, and it is absent from that section, this is an incorrect answer.

Looking at the HPI section, I can find: 'States that patient is accompanied by daughter who has been providing assistance and made home safety modifications; son also available to help.' This mentions that the daughter made home safety modifications, but it does not specifically state that she removed rugs or evaluated the home for safety hazards. However, in the Plan section under 'Patient education,' it states: 'States that patient was advised on importance of home safety modifications including removal of throw rugs, installing grab bars, and keeping frequently used items within easy reach.' This indicates the patient was advised to remove rugs, but does not confirm the daughter has already done so. Additionally, in the Plan section under 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments,' it states: 'States that son is to install grab bar in shower this weekend,' indicating future actions rather than completed actions. The specific detail that the daughter has removed rugs and evaluated the home for safety hazards is not explicitly stated in the HPI. While home safety modifications are mentioned generally in the HPI, the specific actions of removing rugs and evaluating for hazards are only mentioned as recommendations in the Plan section, not as completed actions in the HPI. This is a non-critical detail (it's a recommendation about home safety rather than a critical clinical detail like allergies or substance use), so if it were present but miscategorized, it would pass.

Examining the HPI section, I find that it documents the patient's current functional struggles (unable to dress, bathe independently) and her prior independence (was completely independent with dressing, bathing, cooking, and cleaning). However, the HPI does not explicitly state the patient's goals or desires to return to these activities. The Plan section mentions that 'physical therapy goals include return to prior recreational activities (bowling, golf, gardening) when appropriate per healing timeline,' but this is the therapist's goal, not an explicit statement of what the patient stated she would like to do. The HPI focuses on current limitations and past abilities rather than the patient's stated rehabilitation goals or desires. While the patient's motivation to regain independence can be inferred from context (her anxiety about dependence, her prior activities), the specific statement that 'patient would like to get back to dressing independently, showering safely, light cooking, and eventually gardening' is not present in the HPI as a direct quote or clear paraphrase of patient goals. This is not a critical detail (it's a goal/motivation rather than an allergy or substance use), so if it were present but miscategorized it would pass, but it is not present in the HPI at all.",HPI

The HPI does not explicitly state that the patient 'has been doing daily physical therapy.' The Plan section does mention 'States that patient is to receive daily occupational therapy and physical therapy 7 days per week while inpatient,' but this is a future plan, not something the patient has been doing.

This documents the CURRENT/RECENT right total shoulder arthroplasty (a few days ago), not a PREVIOUS one. The note does mention other previous surgeries (laparoscopic cholecystectomy, bilateral cataract removal, endoscopies, colonoscopy), but the right TSA documented is the acute/current surgery the patient is recovering from, not a prior surgical history. The CHECK specifically asks for 'previous right total shoulder arthroplasty,' which would imply a prior surgery before the current one. The SOAP note does not document a previous right TSA—only the current one.

This statement is present and correctly categorized in the Surgical history/hospitalizations section. The dates match exactly (5/12, 5/31, and 7/20), and the detail about having 3 recent endoscopies this year is clearly documented. While this is a procedural history detail that could arguably be considered important for patient care, it is not a 'critical' detail in the sense defined in the prompt (like allergies or substance use that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized).

Hyperlipidemia is the medical term for high cholesterol/elevated lipid levels. This detail is present and correctly categorized in the Past Medical History section where it belongs. The fact that the note uses the clinical term 'hyperlipidemia' rather than the lay term 'high cholesterol' does not change that the information is present and properly documented.

Examining the Past Medical History section, I find: 'States that patient has a history of degenerative joint disease/arthritis affecting knees, hands, and bilateral shoulders.' The note documents 'degenerative joint disease/arthritis' rather than specifically using the term 'osteoarthritis.' However, degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis are clinically synonymous terms - osteoarthritis is the most common form of degenerative joint disease. The clinical detail is present and correctly categorized in Past Medical History. This is not a critical detail (it's not an allergy or substance use that could be missed), so even if there were minor terminology differences, the presence of the equivalent clinical information in the correct section constitutes a pass.

There is NO mention of the patient maintaining a diet of simple and soft foods manageable with one hand in the Social History section. While the Plan section mentions 'patient was advised to maintain dietary modifications for IBS and diverticulitis management,' this is advice given, not a statement about what the patient has maintained.

The SOAP note mentions 'several months for full recovery' but does not explicitly state 'gradually regaining motion and strength.' However, the note does mention counseling on 'continue prescribed exercises including pendulum movements and ball squeezing' and 'importance of not rushing recovery process,' which implies gradual recovery. The specific phrase about 'gradually regaining motion and strength' is not present in the documented patient education. Since this is a non-critical detail (it's a general educational point about recovery expectations, not a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use), and the general concept of recovery timeline is present but the specific detail about 'gradually regaining motion and strength' is not explicitly documented, this is technically an incomplete match to the exact check requested.",Patient education
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments, States that patient should continue to not bear weight on right upper extremity",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section states that the patient should continue to not bear weight on right upper extremity. Looking at the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section, I can see multiple references to weight bearing restrictions: (1) 'States that patient is to continue wearing shoulder immobilizer/sling until cleared by surgeon' and (2) in the Patient education section (which precedes this), it explicitly states 'States that patient was advised on strict no weight bearing, no lifting, pushing, or pulling restrictions for right upper extremity.' However, the specific instruction to 'continue to not bear weight on right upper extremity' is not explicitly stated in the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section itself. The weight bearing restriction appears in the Patient education section and is mentioned in the Subjective section as a current restriction, but it is not restated as a follow-up instruction in the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section. While this detail is present elsewhere in the note, the CHECK specifically asks if it is stated in the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation for ongoing care rather than a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use that could be missed), and the information is present but in a different section, this would normally be a pass. However, the CHECK is specifically asking about the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section, and the explicit statement about continuing no weight bearing is not present there.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

Looking at the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section, I find: 'States that patient is to continue wearing shoulder immobilizer/sling until cleared by surgeon.' However, this statement does not explicitly mention the exception about removing it for instructed exercises. The detail about removing the immobilizer only for prescribed exercises is actually found in the Patient education section: 'States that patient was advised to maintain shoulder immobilizer/sling at all times except during prescribed exercises.' Since this is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation about post-operative care instructions rather than something that would severely impact patient safety if miscategorized, like allergies or substance use), and the information IS present in the note but in a different section (Patient education rather than Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments), this would normally be considered a pass. However, the check specifically asks if this detail is stated IN the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section. The exact phrasing requested is not present in that section - the section only mentions continuing to wear the immobilizer until cleared by surgeon, without the specific exception for instructed exercises.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

Looking at the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section, I can see detailed follow-up instructions including therapy schedules, equipment training, and surgical follow-up. However, the specific instruction to 'continue to avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling with impacted shoulder' is NOT present in this section. This instruction does appear in the Patient education section where it states 'States that patient was advised on strict no weight bearing, no lifting, pushing, or pulling restrictions for right upper extremity.' Since this is a non-critical detail (it's a recommendation/instruction rather than a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use), and the detail IS present in the note but in a different section (Patient education rather than Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments), this would normally be a pass. However, the CHECK specifically asks if this detail is stated IN the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section, and it is not there. The detail is missing from the specified section.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments, States patient is to continue gait training and balance exercises with physical therapy team",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section states that the patient is to continue gait training and balance exercises with physical therapy team. Examining the SOAP note's 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments' section, I find the following relevant statement: 'States that patient is to follow up with outpatient physical therapy at Fairchild Medical Center after discharge for gait training, balance exercises, stair training, strengthening, endurance training, and high-level activity progression.' This statement explicitly mentions both 'gait training' and 'balance exercises' as part of the physical therapy plan. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the appropriate section. This is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation for follow-up care, not a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use), so even if it were miscategorized, it would pass. However, in this case, it is both present and correctly placed.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments, States physical therapy team will evaluate for further assisting equipment, including reacher or sock aid",Pass,Low,"The CHECK asks whether the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section states that 'physical therapy team will evaluate for further assisting equipment, including reacher or sock aid.' Looking at the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section, I find: 'States that occupational therapy will evaluate patient for and train on use of adaptive equipment including reachers, sock aids, and other assistive devices.' The detail about evaluating for assistive equipment including reachers and sock aids is present in the SOAP note, but it is attributed to occupational therapy, not physical therapy. However, the CHECK specifies this should be under physical therapy. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation about which therapy team performs the evaluation, and the information about the evaluation itself is documented), and the detail IS present in the note but in a different category/attribution, this meets the criterion for a pass per the instructions: 'If a detail is not critical and is present but incorrectly categorized, it is a pass.'",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

This explicitly mentions both 'strengthening' and 'endurance training' as components of the physical therapy plan. Additionally, (2) 'States that occupational therapy will focus on activities of daily living training including dressing, bathing, home management tasks, self-care skills, strengthening, and range of motion as healing allows.' This also mentions 'strengthening.' The detail about continuing to work on strength and endurance is present in the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section. This is not a critical detail (it is a recommendation for therapy goals rather than a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use), so even if it were slightly miscategorized, it would still pass.

The note does mention '2-3 times per week' but only for occupational therapy: 'States that patient is to follow up with outpatient occupational therapy 2-3 times per week at Fairchild Medical Center after discharge.' The physical therapy follow-up frequency is not specified with the same detail. Since this is a recommendation (not a critical detail like allergies or substance use), and the general concept of outpatient physical therapy at Fairchild Medical Center is present but the specific frequency detail is missing, this represents an incomplete documentation of the detail specified in the CHECK.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

The detail about monitoring left shoulder pain and reporting to therapist IS present in the note. While it's categorized under 'Patient education' rather than 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments,' this is not a critical detail (it's not an allergy or substance use history that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized). The information is present and conveys the same clinical guidance. Therefore, this meets the criterion.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

Patient to proceed with scheduled sleep study this upcoming Monday at Lebonheur East Surgery Center to evaluate for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.
Provider will follow up with the sleep medicine clinic to ensure the referral for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is processed.

States that patient was counseled on the benefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) for addressing thought patterns that interfere with sleep.

States that patient was advised to continue current medications, including melatonin, without changes pending sleep study results.
States that patient was counseled on the potential for her primary care provider to evaluate the cause of her long-standing nocturia, as addressing it may improve sleep continuity.
States that patient was advised on deep breathing exercises to help manage racing thoughts when unable to sleep.

**Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments:**
States that patient is to follow up with her primary care provider to discuss management of her blood pressure and to seek evaluation for nocturia.

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, States patient has diverticulitis",Pass,High,"The Past Medical History section explicitly lists 'diverticulitis' among the patient's conditions. Diverticulitis is not classified as a 'critical' detail in this context, so its inclusion in Past Medical History is appropriate.",Past Medical History

Anxiety is non-critical and is documented in the Past Medical History as stated.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, States patient has chronic lower back pain",Pass,High,"The Past Medical History explicitly lists 'chronic back pain.' The check requests 'chronic lower back pain' — the note does not specify 'lower' but does document chronic back pain in the PMH. This is not a critical detail, so the presence of chronic back pain in PMH satisfies the recommendation.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, States patient has osteoarthritis",Pass,High,"The Past Medical History states 'arthritis/degenerative joint disease (knees, hands, shoulders)', which corresponds to osteoarthritis and is listed in the Past Medical History section. Osteoarthritis is not a critical detail here, so this satisfies the criterion.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Family History, N/A",Pass,High,"The SOAP note explicitly contains a 'Family History' section with the value 'N/A'. Family history is not classified as a critical detail here, so listing it as 'N/A' satisfies the check.",Family History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, States that patient lives alone at home, but her children live close and willing to help",Pass,High,"The Social History notes the patient 'lives at home, usually alone' and that 'her daughter and son are providing care and support post-operatively,' which matches the check that she lives alone but her children are nearby and helping. This is a non-critical social detail and is correctly documented.",Social History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, States before the injury patient would go bowling once a month and golf occasionally",Fail,High,"The Social History section of the SOAP note does not mention that the patient went bowling once a month or golfed occasionally prior to the injury.

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, States that patient has maintained a diet of simple and soft foods manageable with one hand.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the Social History states the patient has maintained a diet of simple, soft foods manageable with one hand.

This explicitly denies numbness and tingling (which would include the fingers), so the requested detail is present in the ROS.",Review of System
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In General Survey, N/A",Fail,High,"The check specifies that General Survey should be 'N/A'. In the provided SOAP note, the General Survey section contains content: 'patient is alert, cooperative, and oriented, providing a detailed history.

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Vitals, N/A",Pass,High,"The SOAP note's Vitals section explicitly shows multiple 'N/A' entries. The check requested 'In Vitals, N/A', which matches exactly. This is a non-critical recommendation, so the presence of 'N/A' in Vitals is correct.",Vitals
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Physical Exam, N/A",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the Physical Exam contains 'N/A'. In the SOAP note the Vitals section shows multiple 'N/A' entries, but the Physical Exam entries show 'Exam deferred' for several systems and include actual findings for musculoskeletal, extremities, skin, neurological, and psychological. There is no literal 'N/A' in the Physical Exam section. Therefore the criterion is not met.",Physical Exam
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Labs/Diagnostics, States patient most recent AM-PAC score of 16/24",Pass,High,"The Labs/Diagnostics section explicitly states the patient’s AM-PAC score is 16 out of 24, which matches the check.

However, aftercare instructions (daily inpatient OT/PT, outpatient OT/PT referrals, surgical precautions, home safety recommendations, and surgeon follow-up) are clearly documented in the Plan.

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered, N/A",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered' entry is 'N/A'.

It also includes adherence to surgical precautions (sling use, no weight-bearing), which supports being careful during movement. Therefore the requested recommendation is present in Patient education.",Patient education

The Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section mentions follow-up with outpatient PT/OT 2-3 times per week but does not explicitly repeat 'gait training and balance exercises' there.

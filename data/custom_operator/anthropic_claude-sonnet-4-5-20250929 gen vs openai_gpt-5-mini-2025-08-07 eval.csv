The note mentions partial dentures and use of denture adhesive in Medications and that partial dentures are in place on exam, but there is no mention anywhere (including HPI) of difficulty cleaning dentures.

The HPI does not verbatim record the patient stating those goals; it documents prior independence with dressing, bathing, and cooking and that the patient enjoyed gardening, plus concerns about dependence. The Plan/therapy sections explicitly address these goals: occupational therapy will focus on ADLs (dressing, bathing, home management) and physical therapy lists return to prior recreational activities including gardening. Because this is a non‑critical detail and the same goals/activities are documented elsewhere in the note, the check can be considered satisfied (pass).",HPI

Looking at the Header section of the SOAP note, it states: 'States that provider is Dr. Reeves from the Family Medicine clinic. States that patient is Ms. Bergemann. Code status: N/A.' The location information (Bearden, Florida) is NOT in the Header section. Instead, it appears in the HPI section where it states 'Lives in Bearden, Florida.' While the detail about the patient being in Bearden, FL is present in the note, it is incorrectly categorized—it is in the HPI rather than in the Header. However, since location/residence is not a critical detail that would severely impact patient care or clinical decision-making if miscategorized, this constitutes an incorrect categorization of a non-critical detail. According to the instructions, if a detail is not critical and is present but incorrectly categorized, it is a pass. Therefore, this should be marked as correct.",Header

Examining the Header section of the SOAP note, it contains: 'States that provider is Dr. Reeves from the Family Medicine clinic. States that patient is Ms. Bergemann. Code status: N/A.' There is no date mentioned anywhere in the Header section. The note does reference 'Monday' for a scheduled sleep study and various historical dates (April 2021, August 2019, etc.), but no current visit date of September 25, 2024 is stated in the Header. This is a non-critical detail (it is a recommendation to include the date in the header for documentation purposes, but omitting it does not severely impact patient care or clinical decision-making). However, the CHECK specifically asks if the Header 'States date as September 25, 2024,' and this information is simply not present in the Header section.",Header

Looking at the Header section under Subjective, it states: 'States that provider is Dr. Reeves from the Family Medicine clinic. States that patient is Ms. Bergemann. Code status: N/A.' The Header does not explicitly state that the visit is being conducted via video telehealth. However, there is evidence throughout the note that indicates this is a video visit: (1) In the HPI, it states 'at home alone during video visit'; (2) In the Physical Exam section under Objective, it states 'Video exam: Mental status at baseline...' These details confirm the visit was conducted via video telehealth, but this information is not stated in the Header itself as required by the CHECK. The detail about the visit being via video telehealth is present in the note but is incorrectly categorized—it appears in the HPI and Physical Exam sections rather than in the Header. Since this is not a critical detail (it does not severely impact patient care or clinical decision-making), and the information is present but in the wrong section, this would normally be a pass. However, the CHECK specifically asks if the Header states this information, and the Header does not contain this statement. Therefore, the CHECK is not met as specified.",Header
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Chief Complaint(s), States patient is presenting over telehealth for worsening insomnia",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the Chief Complaint states that the patient is presenting over telehealth for worsening insomnia. Looking at the Chief Complaint section in the SOAP note, it states: 'States that patient is present for/presenting with chronic sleep issues/insomnia.' The note does document that this is a telehealth visit (mentioned in the HPI: 'at home alone during video visit' and in Physical Exam: 'Video exam'). However, the Chief Complaint section itself does not explicitly state 'over telehealth' - it only mentions the presenting complaint of chronic sleep issues/insomnia. The telehealth modality is documented elsewhere in the note but not specifically in the Chief Complaint section. Additionally, while the note mentions 'worsening recently,' the Chief Complaint section uses the phrase 'chronic sleep issues/insomnia' without explicitly stating 'worsening.' This is not a critical detail (the telehealth modality and worsening status are documented in the note, just not in the Chief Complaint section specifically), so technically this would be a pass if the information is present elsewhere. However, the CHECK is specifically asking if the Chief Complaint section states this detail. The Chief Complaint section does not explicitly include 'over telehealth' or 'worsening' in its statement - it only says the patient is presenting with 'chronic sleep issues/insomnia.' Since the CHECK is asking about what is stated IN the Chief Complaint section specifically, and the telehealth modality is not mentioned there, this is technically incomplete as written in that section.",Chief Complaint(s)

This clearly indicates that the patient is at home and alone during the video visit. The detail is present in the HPI section where it should be.

Looking at the HPI section of the SOAP note, I find the following relevant statement: 'Reports difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep for ~20 years, worsening recently.' This directly matches the detail specified in the CHECK. The information is present in the correct category (HPI - History of Present Illness), which is where sleep complaint details should be documented. The note clearly documents both the duration (20 years) and the recent worsening, exactly as specified in the CHECK.",HPI

Examining the HPI section, I find: 'Describes lying awake with ""mind racing""; wakes nightly to urinate and often cannot return to sleep; may be awake 1–3 hours and sometimes gets up at 4–5 AM.' This directly captures both elements: (1) mind racing at night, and (2) frequently waking up and struggling to return to sleep. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the HPI section where it belongs. This is not a critical detail issue (it's appropriately placed in HPI as part of the sleep complaint history), so even if there were any minor categorization concerns, it would still pass. The information is clearly and explicitly documented in the HPI.",HPI

Examining the HPI section:
- Consistent sleep routine: YES - ""Uses consistent sleep routine (bedtime 10 PM, cool room, no TV)""
- Cool room: YES - explicitly mentioned
- No TV in bedroom: YES - explicitly mentioned
- Melatonin 3 mg: YES - ""melatonin 3 mg at 9 PM nightly for 1–2 years""
- Timing of melatonin: DISCREPANCY - The CHECK specifies ""1 hour before bed"" but the note states melatonin is taken ""at 9 PM"" with bedtime at ""10 PM"", which is actually 1 hour before bed. This matches.
- Duration: YES - ""for 1–2 years"" matches ""for the last year or two""
- Goes to sleep every night at 10 pm: YES - ""bedtime 10 PM""

All the details specified in the CHECK are present in the HPI. The melatonin timing of 9 PM with a 10 PM bedtime equals 1 hour before bed, which matches the CHECK requirement. This is not a critical detail (it's a sleep hygiene recommendation, not an allergy or substance use history that would severely impact care if miscategorized), and it is correctly placed in the HPI section where it belongs.",HPI

Looking at the HPI section, I can find the relevant text: 'melatonin 3 mg at 9 PM nightly for 1–2 years (initial benefit, now minimal).' This clearly documents that melatonin provided initial benefit but now has minimal effectiveness. The detail is present in the HPI section where it should be according to the CHECK. The phrasing is slightly different ('now minimal' vs 'cannot tell how effective it is now'), but the clinical meaning is essentially the same—the patient is reporting that the initial benefit has diminished. This is not a critical detail (it's not an allergy or substance use history that could severely impact care if miscategorized), so even if there were minor wording differences, the presence of this information in the correct HPI section would constitute a pass.

The HPI does contain all the key elements specified in the CHECK: (1) wakes up at night to use the bathroom every night, (2) has been doing so for decades, and (3) is typically awake 1-3 hours afterwards. While the phrasing is slightly different from the CHECK's wording, the substantive information is present and correctly located in the HPI section. This is not a critical detail issue (nocturia is appropriately documented in HPI as part of the sleep complaint history), so even if there were minor categorization concerns, it would still pass.

Looking at the HPI section of the SOAP note, I find the following relevant text: 'wakes nightly to urinate and often cannot return to sleep; may be awake 1–3 hours and sometimes gets up at 4–5 AM.' This matches the detail specified in the CHECK. The patient is described as being awake for 1-3 hours (which encompasses the 2-3 hours mentioned) and getting up at 4-5 AM. The detail is present in the HPI section where it should be. This is not a critical detail (it's a symptom description, not an allergy or substance use history), so even if there were minor categorization issues, it would pass.

However, the HPI does not explicitly state that the magnesium has had 'no noticeable effect' on her insomnia. The note mentions that melatonin had 'initial benefit, now minimal,' but there is no similar statement about the magnesium's effectiveness or lack thereof regarding insomnia. The magnesium is mentioned as being taken daily, but its efficacy (or lack thereof) for sleep is not documented in the HPI. This detail is present in the medications section but not in the HPI as specified in the check. Since this is a non-critical detail (it's a recommendation about where it should appear, not a critical safety issue), the question is whether it's present in the HPI. It is not explicitly stated in the HPI that magnesium has had no noticeable effect on insomnia.",HPI

Looking at the HPI section: (1) Trazodone is mentioned: 'Previously took trazodone ~5 years ago (stopped; unsure benefit)' - this indicates it was prescribed and stopped, with unclear benefit. (2) ZzzQuil is mentioned: 'Uses ZzzQuil sparingly (half dose) once or twice per month' - this indicates current use, not past use. The CHECK specifies 'tried ZzzQuil in the past' suggesting discontinued use, but the note shows ZzzQuil is currently being used. However, the CHECK also states 'with no improvement that she can remember' - the note says about trazodone 'unsure benefit' (which aligns with no remembered improvement) but does not explicitly state that ZzzQuil provided no improvement. The HPI does document both medications in the context of insomnia treatment attempts, though ZzzQuil appears to be ongoing rather than past. The core information requested is present in the HPI - both medications are mentioned in relation to insomnia treatment. While there's a minor discrepancy about ZzzQuil's current vs. past status, the essential clinical information that the patient tried both medications for insomnia is documented in the HPI section as requested.

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Labs/Diagnostics, N/A",Pass,High,"The check asks whether 'N/A' is present in the Labs/Diagnostics section. Examining the SOAP note, the Labs/Diagnostics section in the Objective portion states 'N/A.' However, in the Plan section under 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered,' there is detailed information about a sleep study that was already scheduled and will be performed. This creates an apparent inconsistency. That said, the check is specifically about what appears in the Labs/Diagnostics section of the Objective portion of the SOAP note, where 'N/A' is indeed documented. The Plan section's mention of ordered/pending labs is a separate part of the note. Since the check asks if 'N/A' is present in Labs/Diagnostics, and it is present in the Objective section where Labs/Diagnostics is categorized, the criterion is met. The fact that pending studies are mentioned in the Plan section does not negate that the Objective Labs/Diagnostics section correctly shows 'N/A' (meaning no results are currently available to report). This is not a critical categorization issue—it's standard practice to mark Labs/Diagnostics as 'N/A' in the Objective section when no results have been received yet, while pending orders are appropriately documented in the Plan section.",Labs/Diagnostics

Insomnia is the primary reason for the visit and is appropriately documented as a diagnosis in the Assessment. This is a CORRECT answer.",Assessment

However, examining the SOAP note, the statement about continuing magnesium glycinate appears in the 'Plan' section under 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered' as part of the instruction to 'continue current regimen (melatonin 3 mg nightly, magnesium glycinate 200 mg daily, multivitamin).' This is a medication continuation instruction, not a diagnostic/imaging order. The actual diagnostic orders in that section are the sleep study and CBT-I referral follow-up. The magnesium glycinate continuation advice is also mentioned in the 'Patient education' section implicitly through the 'continue current regimen' statement. Since this is not a critical detail (magnesium glycinate is a supplement for muscle relaxation, not a critical medication or allergy), and the detail IS present in the note but is incorrectly categorized under 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered' rather than under medication continuation or patient education, this should be treated as a pass per the instructions. However, the CHECK is asking if the detail is 'being ordered' in the Labs/diagnostics section, which is technically incorrect—it's a continuation of an existing medication, not something being ordered. The detail about magnesium glycinate is present but the framing in the CHECK (that it's being 'ordered' in the diagnostics section) does not accurately reflect what appears in the note.",Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered

Looking at the SOAP note, this detail IS present in the document, but it is located in the 'Patient education' section under 'Plan', not in the 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered' section. The exact statement appears as: 'States that patient was advised to continue melatonin 3 mg nightly without dose increase pending sleep study results.' This is a medication counseling/recommendation detail, not a lab, diagnostic, or imaging order. Since this detail is not critical (it's a medication continuation recommendation, not a critical safety issue like an allergy or substance use history that could severely impact patient care if miscategorized), and it IS present in the document but in the wrong section, this meets the criteria for a pass according to the instructions: 'If a detail is not critical and is present but incorrectly categorized, it is a pass.' However, the CHECK specifically states the detail should be 'in Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered' - this is asking if it's in that specific section. The detail is not in that section; it's in Patient education. Therefore, the answer is INCORRECT.",Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Patient education, States that all questions and concerns were addressed.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the Patient education section states that 'all questions and concerns were addressed.' Reviewing the Patient education section of the SOAP note, it documents specific counseling provided: sleep hygiene education, medication continuation advice, nonpharmacologic aids (white noise), relaxation breathing technique, and CBT-I recommendation. However, the note does NOT explicitly state that 'all questions and concerns were addressed.' The note documents what was taught/recommended but does not include a statement confirming that the patient's questions or concerns were addressed or that the patient had no remaining questions. Since this is a recommendation (not a critical detail), the absence of this statement would typically be considered a minor omission. However, the check specifically asks if the note 'states that' this occurred—and it does not. The note simply does not contain this explicit statement.",Patient education

Examining the SOAP note's 'Patient education' section:

1. Sleep hygiene counseling is documented: 'States that patient was counseled on sleep hygiene (consistent bedtime, cool/dark room, avoiding screens/blue light at night, limiting caffeine after noon).'
   - This covers the cool bedroom and avoiding screens/TV.

2. Continuation of current routine: The note states 'States that patient was advised to continue melatonin 3 mg nightly without dose increase pending sleep study results' and in the Plan section: 'No new medications started today; continue current regimen (melatonin 3 mg nightly, magnesium glycinate 200 mg daily, multivitamin). No changes until sleep study results reviewed.'
   - This covers the instruction to continue current routine and that medication changes will be discussed after sleep study results.

The specific language about encouraging continuation of the cool bedroom and no television routine is present in the sleep hygiene counseling section. The statement about discussing medication changes once sleep study results are reviewed is clearly documented in the Plan section.

While the exact phrasing in the CHECK is not verbatim in the note, the substantive content is present and correctly categorized under Patient education and Plan.

The note mentions 'avoiding screens/blue light at night' as part of sleep hygiene counseling, but it does NOT explicitly state that the patient was advised about the mechanism of how blue light interferes with the body's natural sleep signals. The note only mentions that blue light should be avoided, not the educational explanation about why (i.e., that it interferes with natural sleep signals). Since this is a non-critical detail (it's a recommendation about patient education content rather than a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use), and the general concept of avoiding blue light is present but the specific educational detail about interference with sleep signals is not explicitly documented, this would technically be a FAIL for the specific detail requested. However, the spirit of the education is present (avoiding blue light), even if the mechanistic explanation is not documented.",Patient education

Looking at the Patient education section of the SOAP note, I find: 'States that patient was advised to continue melatonin 3 mg nightly without dose increase pending sleep study results; to use ZzzQuil sparingly as currently practiced; and may try white noise/nature sounds as a nonpharmacologic aid.' This statement clearly indicates the patient was advised about white noise/nature sounds as a nonpharmacologic option. While the exact wording differs slightly (the note says 'white noise/nature sounds' rather than specifically 'white noise machine or sleep application'), the substance of the advice is present - the patient was informed she could try white noise as an optional nonpharmacologic aid. This is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation, not a safety-critical item like allergies or substance use), and the information is present in the correct Patient education category. Therefore, this meets the criterion.",Patient education

Looking at the Patient education section in the SOAP note, it states: 'States that it was recommended patient practice relaxation breathing (inhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds) when experiencing racing thoughts at night.' This matches the CHECK exactly - the breathing exercise is documented with the correct counts (4-4-6), and it is appropriately placed in the Patient education section. The detail is present and correctly categorized. This is not a critical detail (it's a non-pharmacologic recommendation, not an allergy or substance use history), so even if it were miscategorized, it would still pass.

However, the specific detail about the CBT-I referral and follow-up on that referral is NOT explicitly stated in the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section. While the HPI section mentions 'Referred for CBT-I; not yet scheduled; provider to follow up on referral,' and the Plan section states 'Provider will follow up with sleep medicine clinic today to ensure CBT-I referral is processed and scheduled,' the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section itself does not contain this information. Since this is a recommendation-level detail (not critical), and it is present in the note but in the wrong section (Plan rather than Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments), this would normally be a pass.

(2) 'States that patient should keep the scheduled sleep study appointment on Monday and contact the clinic sooner if symptoms worsen before then.' The section does mention both elements: the sleep study on Monday and the 1-2 week timeframe for results. However, the phrasing is slightly different - it says 'follow up with sleep medicine in 1-2 weeks after the sleep study for results' rather than explicitly stating 'results coming 1-2 weeks later.' The information is present and correctly categorized in the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section. The detail about the Monday sleep study appointment and the 1-2 week follow-up for results are both documented in the appropriate section.

Examining the 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments' section of the SOAP note:
- It states: 'States that patient is to follow up with primary care provider to evaluate nocturia and review/coordinate management of hypertension and other chronic conditions.'
- It also states: 'States that patient is to follow up with sleep medicine in 1–2 weeks after the sleep study for results and treatment planning.'

The note does mention follow-up with primary care for hypertension and nocturia evaluation. However, the CHECK specifically states 'Will copy report to primary care once established.' This detail about copying the report to primary care is NOT present in the SOAP note's Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section.

Since this is a non-critical detail (it's a procedural/administrative note about report distribution, not a critical clinical safety issue like allergies or substance use), and the main substance of the check (follow-up with primary care for hypertension and nocturia) IS present in the correct section, this would be considered a pass per the instructions: 'If a detail is not critical and is present but incorrectly categorized, it is a pass.'

However, the specific language requested in the CHECK is not present in the Chief Complaint. Since this is a recommendation-level detail (not critical like allergies or substance use), and the essence of the visit (routine well visit/new patient establishment) is captured, though with different wording, this represents an incomplete match to the exact CHECK specification.

1. Cancer-related symptoms: The note states the patient has soft tissue sarcoma on pazopanib under oncology care, but does NOT explicitly state whether there are current cancer-related symptoms or not. The note does not document a specific denial of cancer symptoms.

2. Heart attack symptoms: The note explicitly states 'denies current related symptoms' in reference to the prior myocardial infarction history. This clearly documents the absence of current heart attack symptoms.

3. Other concerns: The chief complaint states 'no acute concerns' for a routine well visit.

While the note documents denial of current heart attack symptoms and indicates no acute concerns, it does NOT explicitly document whether the patient has or denies current cancer-related symptoms. This is a notable omission given that the patient is actively on cancer treatment (pazopanib). The HPI should ideally include a specific statement about current cancer symptoms or lack thereof, especially for a patient with active malignancy.

Since the CHECK specifies this should be in the HPI and the cancer symptom status is not explicitly documented there (though the patient is on active cancer treatment), this detail is incompletely addressed.

The information about food intolerances appears in the HPI under Diet, where it states: 'Diet: low sodium; otherwise normal; denies food intolerances.' This is a critical detail because food intolerances are a type of allergy/intolerance information that should be documented in the Allergies/Intolerance section for easy reference and patient safety. Placing this information in the HPI/Diet section rather than in the dedicated Allergies/Intolerance section means a clinician reviewing the chart quickly for allergies/intolerances might miss this important information.

This confirms that Claritin is documented in the Medications section. While Claritin is also mentioned in the Allergies/Intolerance section as context for why it's being taken, the medication itself is correctly listed in the Medications section where it belongs. Since the detail is present and correctly categorized in the appropriate section, this meets the criterion. The fact that it's also mentioned in Allergies/Intolerance does not detract from its correct placement in Medications.",Medications

Looking at the SOAP note, under the Medications section, there is a specific line that states: 'States that patient currently takes vitamin C daily (dose N/A) for general health.' The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Medications section where it belongs. Vitamin C is a supplement/medication the patient is taking, so this is the appropriate location. The detail is accurately documented and properly placed.",Medications
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Medications, Patient is taking Multivitamin",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the patient is taking Multivitamin in the Medications section. Reviewing the Medications section of the SOAP note, I can confirm that it explicitly states: 'States that patient currently takes a multivitamin daily for general health.' The multivitamin is correctly listed under the Medications category.

Therefore, the check is satisfied.",Medications
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Medications, Patient is taking Probiotics",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the patient is taking Probiotics and if this detail is listed in the Medications section. Reviewing the SOAP note's Medications section, I can confirm that it explicitly states: 'States that patient currently takes probiotics daily for general health.' The detail is present and correctly categorized under Medications. Probiotics are not a critical detail (they are a supplement for general health, not an allergy, critical medication, or substance use history that would impact patient safety if miscategorized). Since the detail is present and in the correct section, this meets the criterion.",Medications
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Medications, Patient is taking Cyproheptadine for common cold symptoms",Pass,High,"The check asks whether cyproheptadine for common cold symptoms is listed in the Medications section. Examining the SOAP note's Medications section, I find: 'States that patient currently takes cyproheptadine (dose/frequency N/A), prescribed for frequent colds.' This detail is present and correctly categorized in the Medications section. The indication (frequent colds/common cold symptoms) is also documented. Since cyproheptadine is a medication being taken by the patient, it belongs in the Medications section, and it is correctly placed there. This is not a critical detail (it would not severely impact patient care if miscategorized), but it is present and correctly categorized, which exceeds the passing threshold.",Medications
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Medications, Patient is smoking Marijuana on occasion, as prescribed",Fail,High,"The check asks whether marijuana use (prescribed, occasional) is listed in the Medications section. According to the SOAP note, marijuana/cannabis use is documented in multiple places: (1) in the Subjective/HPI section under 'Recreational drugs: occasional cannabis use; reports it is prescribed; denies issues with use', (2) in the Social History section, and (3) in the Assessment as 'Cannabis use, episodic'. However, it is NOT listed in the Medications section. The Medications section lists pazopanib, loratadine, vitamin C, multivitamin, probiotics, cyproheptadine, Orajel, and ibuprofen, but does not include cannabis/marijuana. While substance use history is noted as a critical detail that needs to be categorized correctly, cannabis use that is prescribed should arguably be documented in the Medications section since it is a therapeutic agent being used as prescribed. The fact that it is absent from the Medications section represents an incorrect categorization of this detail. Since substance use history is identified as critical in the prompt, this misplacement is a significant error that could impact clinical decision-making and medication management.",Medications
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Medications, Patient is taking Orajel for toothaches",Pass,High,"The check asks whether Orajel for toothaches is listed in the Medications section. Reviewing the SOAP note's Medications section, I can confirm that it explicitly states: 'States that patient currently uses Orajel OTC for toothaches (dose/frequency N/A).' The detail is present and correctly categorized under Medications. Orajel is an over-the-counter topical anesthetic used for toothache relief, and its placement in the Medications section is appropriate. This is not a critical detail (it would not severely impact patient care if miscategorized), but it is correctly placed regardless. The criterion is met.",Medications

Looking at the Medications section of the SOAP note, there is an entry that states: 'States that patient currently uses ibuprofen (Advil) OTC as needed for aches/pains (dose/frequency N/A).' This detail is present and correctly categorized under Medications. The medication is listed with the appropriate context (OTC, as needed, for aches/pains). Since this is not a critical detail (it's an over-the-counter pain reliever, not an allergy or substance use history that would severely impact patient care), and the detail is both present and correctly placed, this meets the criterion.",Medications

Examining the SOAP note: In the Past Medical History section, it states 'States that patient has a history of myocardial infarction (timing unspecified).' Additionally, in the HPI section, it notes 'Reports prior myocardial infarction in the past; denies current related symptoms.' The detail is present in the Past Medical History section as required, the timing is correctly noted as unspecified, and the patient denies current related symptoms which aligns with 'managed without symptoms.' The myocardial infarction is also appropriately listed in the Assessment section. All elements of the CHECK are satisfied - the detail is in the correct category (Past Medical History), timing is unspecified, and symptom status is documented. This is a critical detail (cardiac history significantly impacts patient care), and it is correctly categorized and documented.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Past Medical History, Patient has hypertension",Pass,High,"The check asks whether hypertension is present in the Past Medical History section. Examining the SOAP note's Past Medical History section, I can confirm that it explicitly states: 'States that patient has hypertension (managed with lifestyle).'

Examining the SOAP note, the Past Medical History section includes: 'States that patient has hyperlipidemia.' Hyperlipidemia is the medical term for high cholesterol. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Past Medical History section where it belongs. While the terminology differs slightly (hyperlipidemia vs. high cholesterol), these are clinically equivalent terms for the same condition. This is not a critical detail that would be misplaced (such as an allergy or substance use), and the information is accurately documented in the appropriate section. Therefore, the check is satisfied.",Past Medical History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, Patient maintaining a low sodium diet",Pass,Low,"The check asks whether 'Patient maintaining a low sodium diet' is present in the Social History section. Looking at the SOAP note, the low sodium diet is mentioned in the HPI (History of Present Illness) section under 'Diet: low sodium; otherwise normal; denies food intolerances.' However, it is NOT mentioned in the Social History section. The Social History section lists tobacco use, alcohol use, cannabis use, occupation, living situation, hobbies, and sexual activity, but does not include dietary information. While the low sodium diet is a lifestyle/dietary detail that could reasonably be categorized in Social History, it is not critical information in the same way that allergies or substance use would be. Dietary habits are typically recommendations or lifestyle modifications rather than critical safety information. Since this detail is present in the note but in an incorrect section (HPI instead of Social History), and it is not a critical detail, this should be considered a pass according to the instructions: 'If a detail is not critical and is present but incorrectly categorized, it is a pass.'",Social History

Examining the Social History section of the SOAP note, I can confirm that this detail is indeed present: 'States that patient's hobbies include high-intensity workouts, online world-building, and letterbox games.' The information about intense/high-intensity workouts is correctly categorized under Social History. Additionally, this detail also appears in the HPI section ('Exercise: daily high-intensity workouts; asked if this could be an issue.'). Since the detail is present and correctly placed in the Social History section, and this is not a critical detail (it's a lifestyle/hobby detail that doesn't severely impact patient care if miscategorized), the check passes.",Social History

,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, Patient does Minecraft computer gaming and letterbox games in his spare time",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the Social History section contains 'Patient does Minecraft computer gaming and letterbox games in his spare time.' Looking at the Social History section of the SOAP note, I can find: 'States that patient's hobbies include high-intensity workouts, online world-building, and letterbox games.' The note mentions 'letterbox games' which matches the CHECK, but it says 'online world-building' rather than specifically 'Minecraft computer gaming.' While 'online world-building' could reasonably refer to Minecraft or similar games, the SOAP note does not explicitly state 'Minecraft.' The CHECK specifies 'Minecraft computer gaming' as a distinct detail. Since hobbies/recreational activities are not critical details that would severely impact patient care or clinical decision-making, this would be a non-critical detail. However, the specific detail requested (Minecraft) is not explicitly present in the note—only a general reference to 'online world-building' is documented. The detail is partially present but not exactly as specified in the CHECK.",Social History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, Patient drinks beer on occasion, not more than 3 drinks per week",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the detail 'Patient drinks beer on occasion, not more than 3 drinks per week' is present in the Social History section. Examining the Social History section of the SOAP note, I can confirm this information is present: 'States that patient admits alcohol use: occasional beer, up to ~3 drinks/week; denies binge drinking.' The detail is correctly categorized under Social History, which is the appropriate section for substance use history. While substance use history is noted as a critical detail in the prompt, it is correctly placed in Social History here, so there is no categorization error.

This is a detail about binge drinking patterns and alcohol use frequency. In the Social History section, the note clearly states: 'States that patient admits alcohol use: occasional beer, up to ~3 drinks/week; denies binge drinking.' This explicitly documents that the patient denies binge drinking and reports only ~3 drinks per week, which means the patient does not have more than 5 drinks in 1 night. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Social History section. While substance use history is critical information, in this case the detail is both present and properly placed, so the criterion is met.",Social History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Social History, Patient does not smoke cigarettes",Pass,High,"The check asks whether 'Patient does not smoke cigarettes' is documented in the Social History section. Examining the Social History section of the SOAP note, I can find: 'States that patient denies tobacco use/history.' This clearly documents that the patient does not smoke cigarettes (tobacco use denial). The information is present and correctly categorized in the Social History section where substance use history belongs. This is also a critical detail since substance use history must be properly documented and categorized for patient care. The detail is both present and correctly placed.",Social History

Examining the Social History section of the SOAP note, I can confirm that marijuana/cannabis use is documented: 'States that patient admits occasional cannabis use; reports it is prescribed; denies issues related to use.' This detail is present and correctly categorized under Social History. While the terminology differs slightly (cannabis vs. marijuana), the substance and frequency (occasional use) match the check requirement. Substance use history is a critical detail that must be categorized correctly, and in this case it is properly placed in the Social History section where it belongs.

Examining the Social History section of the SOAP note, I find the following statement: 'States that patient is not currently sexually active; had one partner in the past year.' This directly matches the required detail. The information is present and correctly categorized under Social History, which is the appropriate location for sexual history information. While sexual history can be important for patient care (particularly regarding STI screening, which is appropriately addressed in the Plan), it is not a 'critical' detail in the sense defined in the prompt (i.e., it would not severely impact patient care if miscategorized like allergies or substance use would). The detail is both present and correctly placed.",Social History
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Review of System, General positive for fatigue, negative for fever or chills",Fail,High,"The CHECK requires that the Review of System section should document: General positive for fatigue, negative for fever or chills. However, in the provided SOAP note, the Review of System section is marked as 'N/A.' with no documented findings. The fatigue and fever/chills information is completely absent from the note. Since this is a routine well visit for a 54-year-old patient with significant medical history (prior MI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, active cancer on chemotherapy), a Review of System should be documented. While fatigue and fever/chills are not critical details in the same way allergies or substance use are (they would not severely hinder immediate patient care if miscategorized), the detail is entirely missing rather than miscategorized. The check specifically asks if this detail is present under the Review of System category, and it is not present at all.",Review of System

However, in the SOAP note provided, the Review of System section is marked as 'N/A.' with no documented findings. While the information about seasonal allergies and frequent colds IS present in the note (documented in Allergies/Intolerance, Past Medical History, and Medications sections), it is NOT documented in the Review of System section where it should be according to the CHECK. Since this is a non-critical detail (the allergies and cold history are properly documented elsewhere and won't hinder patient care), the incorrect categorization/placement would typically be a pass. However, the CHECK is specifically asking whether these details appear in the Review of System section, and they do not - the ROS is completely blank. The detail is present in the note but not in the specified location (Review of System). Given that this is a structural/organizational issue rather than a critical safety concern, and the information is documented elsewhere appropriately, this would be considered a FAIL for meeting the specific CHECK requirement, as the ROS section does not contain the specified information.",Review of System

States pt has an active lifestyle.' However, in the SOAP note provided, the Review of System section is marked as 'N/A.' with no documented cardiovascular assessment. While cardiovascular-related information IS present in the note (scattered throughout the HPI, Past Medical History, and Social History sections), it is not documented in the Review of System category where it should be located. This is a critical detail because cardiovascular assessment is a fundamental component of the ROS, especially for a patient with significant cardiac history (prior MI) and hypertension. The information exists in the note but is incorrectly categorized/missing from the appropriate section. Since this involves proper documentation structure for a patient with critical cardiac history, this represents a documentation error that could impact clinical organization and completeness of the ROS.",Review of System
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Review of System, Respiratory: No shortness of breath or cough.",Fail,High,"The CHECK requests verification that under 'Review of System, Respiratory' the note should state 'No shortness of breath or cough.' However, examining the SOAP note, the Review of System section shows only 'N/A.' - meaning no respiratory review was documented at all. The specific respiratory findings (no shortness of breath or cough) are not present in the note. This is a non-critical detail (respiratory symptoms are important for documentation but not critical in the sense that misplacing them would severely impact patient care). However, the detail itself is completely absent from the Review of System section rather than being present but miscategorized. Since the CHECK is asking whether this detail exists in the specified location and it does not exist anywhere in the note, this is an INCORRECT answer.",Review of System

However, examining the SOAP note, the Review of System section is marked as 'N/A.' - meaning no review of systems details are documented at all, including musculoskeletal findings. While the note does mention in the Medications section that the patient uses ibuprofen (Advil) OTC 'as needed for aches/pains,' this is not the same as a documented musculoskeletal ROS finding. The check is looking for a specific ROS documentation that is absent from the note. Since the Review of System section is completely blank/N/A, the specific musculoskeletal detail requested in the check is not present in the appropriate category.

However, in the SOAP note provided, the Review of System section simply states 'N/A.' with no documented negative findings for neurological, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. While this is a recommendation-level detail (not critical), the specific negative findings for these three system categories are not present in the Review of System section. The note does not explicitly document that the provider assessed and found these systems to be negative.

While the terminology differs (hyperlipidemia vs. high cholesterol), they refer to the same clinical condition. The diagnosis is present in the Assessment section under the correct category. The patient's high cholesterol is also documented in the Subjective section (HPI) and Past Medical History, and a lipid panel is appropriately ordered in the Plan. Since this is not a critical detail (it's correctly categorized in Assessment, just using standard medical terminology rather than lay terminology), and the clinical concept is accurately represented, this meets the criterion.",Assessment

Looking at the SOAP note, toothaches are NOT mentioned in the Assessment section. However, toothaches ARE mentioned in the Medications section of the Subjective, where it states 'States that patient currently uses Orajel OTC for toothaches (dose/frequency N/A).' This is a non-critical detail (toothaches are a minor symptom, not a serious condition that would severely impact patient care or clinical decision-making). Since the detail is present in the note but in an incorrect category (Medications rather than Assessment/Diagnosis), and since toothaches are not a critical detail, this would normally be considered a pass. However, the check specifically asks if toothaches appear as a diagnosis in the Assessment section. They do not appear there. The patient is on a routine well visit with no acute concerns, and toothaches were only mentioned as an incidental finding related to OTC medication use, not as a formal diagnosis being assessed.

Examining the Plan section under 'Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered', I can see: 'Lipid panel to assess hyperlipidemia; new labs to be obtained as prior results are unavailable.' A lipid panel is the standard laboratory test that measures cholesterol levels (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides). While the note uses the term 'lipid panel' rather than explicitly stating 'cholesterol', this is the appropriate and standard medical terminology for ordering cholesterol work. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the proper section. This is not a critical detail (it's a routine lab order for a well visit), so even if there were minor terminology differences, it would still pass.

Examining the Patient education section of the SOAP note, I find: 'States that it was recommended patient request STI testing as desired prior to new sexual partners.' The note documents that STI testing was recommended prior to new sexual partners, which conveys the same clinical guidance as the check specifies. However, the check specifies that the patient should 'reach out to office' for testing, whereas the note only states the patient was 'recommended' to 'request' STI testing without explicitly documenting that the office is available as a resource for this testing. Additionally, the check uses 'he' (male pronoun) while the patient is female (Mary Smith Gonzales), though this may be a generic pronoun issue in the check itself. The core clinical recommendation is present and appropriately categorized in Patient education. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation for preventive care, not a safety-critical item like allergies or substance use categorization), and the substance of the recommendation is documented, this constitutes a pass despite minor wording differences.",Patient education

Looking at the Patient education section of the SOAP note, it states: 'States that patient was advised to incorporate strength training every 3–4 days in addition to HIIT to support bone health; ensure adequate protein intake and hydration.' The note mentions incorporating strength training every 3-4 days IN ADDITION to HIIT, but does not explicitly state that the patient should take a break FROM high intensity interval training every 3-4 days. These are different recommendations - one is about adding strength training frequency, the other is about taking breaks from HIIT. The specific detail requested in the CHECK is not present in the SOAP note.

Examining the Patient education section of the SOAP note, I find: 'States that patient was advised to incorporate strength training every 3–4 days in addition to HIIT to support bone health; ensure adequate protein intake and hydration.' The SOAP note does document that the patient was advised to start strength training to support bone health. However, the specific reasoning provided in the CHECK ('as aging causing loss of estrogen and brittle bones') is not explicitly stated in the note. The note mentions 'bone health' as the rationale but does not specifically reference estrogen loss or brittle bones as the clinical reasoning. Since the detail (strength training recommendation) IS present in the Patient education section and IS correctly categorized, this meets the criterion. The specific clinical explanation differs slightly, but the core recommendation is documented. This is not a critical detail (it would not severely impact patient or doctor care if the exact wording of the rationale varied), so presence in the correct category constitutes a pass.",Patient education

Examining the Chief Complaint(s) section in the SOAP note, it reads: 'Postoperative recovery after right total shoulder arthroplasty with difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs), especially dressing and bathing; concerns about balance and safety. Pain manageable (3–4/10).' This clearly documents that the patient is presenting for postoperative recovery/rehabilitation evaluation following a right total shoulder arthroplasty. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the Chief Complaint(s) section. This is a critical detail as it establishes the primary reason for the visit and must be in the correct section. The information is accurate and appropriately placed.",Chief Complaint(s)

Examining the HPI section of the SOAP note, the first line reads: '79-year-old female s/p right total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) a few days ago at Orange Regional Medical Center.' This clearly states the patient's age (79 years old) and gender (female) in the HPI section. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the appropriate section. This is a correct placement of demographic information in the HPI.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient DOB is 11/6/1937.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI (History of Present Illness) states that the patient's DOB is 11/6/1937. Looking at the HPI section, it begins with '79-year-old female s/p right total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) a few days ago...' The HPI does not explicitly state the DOB of 11/6/1937. However, the DOB is clearly documented in the Header section under 'Patient: Female, 79 years old (DOB 11/06/1937)'. While the DOB is present in the SOAP note, it is not located in the HPI section as specified in the check. Since DOB is not a critical detail (it is properly categorized in the Header/demographics section where it belongs), and the check specifically asks if it appears in the HPI, this is technically an incorrect placement according to the check's specific requirement. However, this is not a critical error because the DOB is appropriately documented in the correct demographic section. The check fails because the DOB does not appear in the HPI section specifically.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient was referred by Dr. Debernardis.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient was referred by Dr. Debernardis. Looking at the HPI section, it does not mention Dr. Debernardis or any referral by this physician. However, Dr. Debernardis IS mentioned in the Surgical history/hospitalizations section, which states: 'Right total shoulder arthroplasty (a few days ago) at Orange Regional Medical Center; referred/overseen by Dr. Debernardis.' The information about Dr. Debernardis is present in the SOAP note but is categorized under Surgical history/hospitalizations rather than in the HPI section. Since the check specifies the detail should be 'In HPI' and this is not a critical detail (it's a provider/referral source detail that is appropriately documented elsewhere in the note), this would normally be a pass for incorrect categorization of a non-critical detail. However, the check is specifically asking if the HPI states this information, and the HPI does NOT contain this statement. The detail is absent from the HPI section specifically, even though it appears elsewhere in the note.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient’s right shoulder pain has been manageable, but use of the right arm for daily activities continues to be difficult",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the patient's right shoulder pain has been manageable, but use of the right arm for daily activities continues to be difficult. Looking at the HPI section of the SOAP note: The note states 'Pain 3–4/10' (indicating manageable pain) and extensively documents functional difficulties with the right arm, including 'Requires moderate assist for upper body dressing (unable to manage bra); needs some assist for lower body dressing due to balance and back pain; needs assistance with bathing' and 'Difficulty with stairs to bedroom.' The HPI clearly conveys that while pain is manageable (3-4/10), the patient has significant difficulty using the right arm for daily activities. This detail is present and correctly categorized in the HPI section. The detail is not critical (it's a functional assessment rather than an allergy or substance use history), so correct categorization is not mandatory, but in this case it is correctly placed in the HPI where it belongs.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient has been having trouble with activities of daily living, including putting on shirts and pulling up pants, which is increasingly difficult due to prior back pain",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the patient has been having trouble with activities of daily living, specifically putting on shirts and pulling up pants, which is increasingly difficult due to prior back pain. Looking at the HPI section, the note does document ADL difficulties related to dressing: 'Requires moderate assist for upper body dressing (unable to manage bra); needs some assist for lower body dressing due to balance and back pain.' However, the note attributes lower body dressing difficulty to both 'balance and back pain' rather than specifically stating it is 'increasingly difficult due to prior back pain' alone. More importantly, the specific examples mentioned in the CHECK (putting on shirts and pulling up pants) are not explicitly stated in the HPI. The HPI mentions 'upper body dressing' and 'lower body dressing' generically, and mentions 'bra' management, but does not specifically detail 'shirts' or 'pants.' While the general concept of dressing difficulties related to back pain is present in the HPI, the specific details requested in the CHECK (putting on shirts and pulling up pants) are not explicitly documented. Since this is a non-critical detail (it's a recommendation about how to document ADL difficulties, not a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use), the presence of the general concept in the correct category would typically constitute a pass. However, the CHECK is quite specific about the exact details, and those exact details are not present in the HPI as stated.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports daughter has been helping her with dressing.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports her daughter has been helping her with dressing. Examining the HPI section, I find the following relevant passage: 'Functional status: Requires moderate assist for upper body dressing (unable to manage bra); needs some assist for lower body dressing due to balance and back pain; needs assistance with bathing...' and later 'Safety/home setup: Lives alone; daughter and son will alternate providing help initially (at least first 24 hours post-discharge).' Additionally, under 'GI history/procedures': 'Currently managing diet with daughter's help (simple/soft foods).' The HPI describes that the patient requires assistance with dressing and mentions the daughter will help post-discharge, but it does not explicitly state that the daughter 'has been helping her with dressing' in the present or past tense during the current hospitalization or prior to admission. The statement about daughter helping is limited to future post-discharge assistance and diet management. The HPI describes the patient's functional limitations and need for assistance with dressing, but does not specifically attribute this current assistance to the daughter. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a functional/social detail, not an allergy or substance use that would severely impact care), and the information about daughter assistance is present elsewhere in the note (Social History and Safety/home setup sections), this would be a pass if the detail were present but miscategorized. However, the specific statement that the daughter 'has been helping her with dressing' is not clearly stated in the HPI as written.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient has partial dentures and wears glasses",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient has partial dentures and wears glasses. Examining the HPI section, I find the following relevant passage: 'Assistive items: Wears glasses (no current vision problems with glasses). Partial dentures; difficulty cleaning dentures one-handed (uses towel to prevent dropping).' Both details are present in the HPI section. While these items might be considered more appropriately categorized under 'Assistive items' or 'Past Medical History' from a strict organizational standpoint, the check does not specify that the categorization must be perfect—only that the details are stated in the HPI. Since both 'partial dentures' and 'wears glasses' are explicitly mentioned in the HPI section, the criterion is met. Additionally, these are not critical details (like allergies or substance use) that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized, so even if there were a minor categorization issue, it would still pass. The details are present and stated in the HPI as required.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports having three endoscopies this year due to history of ulcers and bleeding.",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports having three endoscopies this year due to history of ulcers and bleeding. Looking at the HPI section of the SOAP note, I can find: 'GI history/procedures: Multiple EGDs this year (5/12, 5/31, 7/20) and colonoscopy on 7/20 for history of ulcers and prior GI bleed.' This confirms three EGDs (endoscopies) performed on those three dates this year, and they were performed for the stated reason of history of ulcers and prior GI bleed. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the HPI section. While the detail is also mentioned in other sections (Surgical history and Labs/Diagnostics), its presence in the HPI is what matters for this check. The information is accurate and appropriately placed.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports having most recent colonoscopy on July 20th.",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports having the most recent colonoscopy on July 20th. Looking at the HPI section, I can confirm that colonoscopy on 7/20 is mentioned: 'GI history/procedures: Multiple EGDs this year (5/12, 5/31, 7/20) and colonoscopy on 7/20 for history of ulcers and prior GI bleed.' This detail is present in the HPI section where it appropriately belongs as part of the patient's history of present illness. The colonoscopy date of July 20th is clearly stated. This is not a critical detail (it's historical procedural information, not an allergy or substance use that would severely impact immediate patient care if miscategorized), so even if it were in a different section, it would still pass. However, it is correctly placed in the HPI, so this meets the criterion.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States prior to surgery patient was independent in all activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, cooking and cleaning",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that prior to surgery the patient was independent in all activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, cooking and cleaning.

Looking at the HPI section, there is a subsection titled 'Prior level of function' which states: 'Previously completely independent with ADLs/IADLs; activities included gardening, occasional bowling, and occasional golf (limited recently by arthritis).'

This statement confirms the patient was independent in ADLs/IADLs prior to surgery. However, the HPI does not explicitly list the specific activities mentioned in the CHECK (bathing, dressing, cooking, and cleaning). The note uses the general term 'completely independent with ADLs/IADLs' rather than enumerating these specific activities.

While the detail about prior independence is present in the HPI and is correctly categorized (it appears in the appropriate section), the specific enumeration of 'bathing, dressing, cooking and cleaning' is not explicitly stated. The note generalizes this as 'ADLs/IADLs' without listing these particular activities.

Since the CHECK specifies exact activities that should be stated, and the note only provides a general statement of independence without the specific enumeration requested, this is technically incomplete. However, the substance of the information (prior complete independence in ADLs) is present and correctly placed in the HPI. This is not a critical detail (it's functional history, not an allergy or substance use that would severely impact care), so presence with general rather than specific language would typically pass. But the CHECK asks for a specific detail that is not fully present as stated.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient is using a shoulder immobilizer",Pass,Low,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient is using a shoulder immobilizer. Looking at the HPI section, the note states: 'Pain 3–4/10; using sling at all times; right upper extremity non-weight-bearing.' The patient is described as using a 'sling,' not an 'immobilizer.' While these are similar devices used for shoulder support post-operatively, they are technically different terms. However, the Review of Systems section does mention 'Postoperative right shoulder with immobilizer' under Musculoskeletal. The detail about shoulder support IS present in the HPI (as a sling), and the immobilizer terminology appears elsewhere in the note. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a minor terminology distinction about the type of shoulder support device, and the clinical meaning is essentially the same), and the substance of the detail (patient using shoulder support) is present in the HPI, this would constitute a pass. The patient IS using shoulder support equipment in the HPI as stated. The specific terminology difference (sling vs. immobilizer) is a non-critical categorization issue.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports she is fatigued easier following procedure.",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports she is fatigued easier following the procedure. Looking at the HPI section, I can see detailed information about the patient's postoperative status, functional limitations, pain level, therapy assessments, and various symptoms. However, the HPI does not explicitly state that the patient reports increased fatigue following the procedure. While the Review of Systems section does mention 'Reports increased fatigue with activities' under Constitutional, this is located in the ROS, not in the HPI. The HPI focuses on pain level (3-4/10), functional status with ADLs, therapy assessments, prior level of function, safety concerns, and other postoperative details, but does not specifically document the patient reporting easier fatigue following the procedure. Since the check specifies the detail should be in the HPI and it is not present there (though it appears elsewhere in the note), this is an INCORRECT answer.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports she has decreased balance, especially with use of sling",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports she has decreased balance, especially with use of sling. Looking at the HPI section, I can find multiple references to balance issues: (1) 'Functional status: Requires moderate assist for upper body dressing (unable to manage bra); needs some assist for lower body dressing due to balance and back pain' and (2) 'Difficulty with stairs to bedroom; holds railing tightly.' Additionally, the Assessment section states 'Impaired functional mobility and self-care due to decreased strength, ROM, balance, and endurance; high fall risk.' However, the specific detail that the patient has 'decreased balance, especially with use of sling' is not explicitly stated in the HPI. The HPI mentions she is 'using sling at all times' and separately mentions balance issues and fear of falling, but does not specifically connect the decreased balance to the use of the sling. The note does mention 'fearful of falling' but does not explicitly state that the sling is causing or contributing to the balance problems. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a clinical observation/recommendation rather than something that would severely impact patient care if miscategorized), and the general concept of balance impairment is present in the HPI, this would typically be considered a pass. However, the specific connection between decreased balance and sling use is not explicitly stated in the HPI as required by the check.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient is afraid to bathe because she might fall and scared to do pendulum and squeezing a ball exercises",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient is afraid to bathe because she might fall and scared to do pendulum and squeezing a ball exercises. Looking at the HPI section: The note states 'needs assistance with bathing; uses shower chair; fearful of falling' and 'Performing pendulum exercises and hand/finger exercises; anxious about movement.' The HPI does document that the patient is fearful of falling related to bathing and is anxious about movement during exercises. However, the specific detail about being 'scared to do pendulum and squeezing a ball exercises' is not explicitly stated as a fear or avoidance behavior in the HPI. The note says she IS performing these exercises while being 'anxious about movement,' but does not state she is scared to do them or refusing them. The fear of falling during bathing is documented, but the specific fear of performing the exercises is not clearly articulated in the HPI as stated in the check. This is a non-critical detail (it's a recommendation for documentation completeness rather than a critical safety issue), but the specific phrasing of the check—that she is 'scared to do' these exercises—is not accurately reflected in the HPI as written. The HPI shows anxiety about movement but active participation in exercises, not avoidance of them.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient’s daughter is able to stay with her for a few days and her son can help as well",Pass,Low,"The check asks whether the HPI contains the detail that 'patient's daughter is able to stay with her for a few days and her son can help as well.' Looking at the HPI section, I find this information is present: 'Safety/home setup: Lives alone; daughter and son will alternate providing help initially (at least first 24 hours post-discharge).' However, this detail is located in the 'Safety/home setup' subsection within the HPI, not as a standalone statement in the main HPI narrative. The information is present in the HPI section overall, though it appears in a subsection rather than the primary narrative flow. Since this is a social support detail (not critical like allergies or substance use), and it IS present within the HPI section, this meets the criterion. The detail about family support is appropriately categorized within HPI as it relates to the patient's social situation and discharge planning context.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports a son to install a grab bar in the shower this weekend, and daughter helps her to shower",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports a son to install a grab bar in the shower this weekend, and daughter helps her to shower. Looking at the HPI section, I find: 'Safety/home setup: Lives alone; daughter and son will alternate providing help initially (at least first 24 hours post-discharge). Throw rugs removed; items placed within easy reach; grab bar by toilet; plan to install shower grab bar. Considering adaptive equipment (reacher, sock aid).' The HPI mentions that there is a 'plan to install shower grab bar' but does not specifically state that the son will install it 'this weekend.' Additionally, while the HPI mentions the daughter and son will 'alternate providing help,' it does not explicitly state that the 'daughter helps her to shower.' The information is present in the note but not with the specific details requested in the CHECK (son installing grab bar this weekend, daughter helping with shower). The detail about family assistance and shower grab bar installation is present but lacks the specificity claimed in the CHECK.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient is going to have a pill organizer for her medications",Fail,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient is going to have a pill organizer for her medications. Looking at the HPI section, I find the following relevant text: 'Uses weekly pill organizer; opening pill bottles is difficult one-handed.' This statement indicates that the patient currently uses a weekly pill organizer, not that she is going to have one in the future. Additionally, in the Medications section, it states: 'Uses weekly pill organizer; daughter assists with setup.' The note also mentions in the Plan under patient education: 'Use adaptive strategies for one-handed tasks (pill organizer, denture care over a towel, adaptive devices as indicated).' While the pill organizer is mentioned in the HPI, it is described as something the patient already uses, not something she is going to have. The check specifically asks if the HPI 'states patient is going to have a pill organizer,' which implies a future plan or recommendation. The HPI describes current use rather than a future plan. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation about medication management organization), even if it were slightly miscategorized, it would typically pass. However, the detail as stated in the check (going to have) does not accurately match what is in the HPI (currently uses). The HPI does not explicitly state she is 'going to have' a pill organizer as a future plan.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that patient reports she sometimes has a hard time cleaning her dentures properly",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient reports she sometimes has a hard time cleaning her dentures properly. Looking at the HPI section, I can find the following relevant text: 'Partial dentures; difficulty cleaning dentures one-handed (uses towel to prevent dropping).' This detail is present in the HPI and accurately describes the patient's difficulty with denture cleaning. The information is correctly categorized under the HPI (History of Present Illness), which is appropriate as it relates to functional limitations and assistive strategies relevant to her current postoperative status. Since the detail is present and correctly placed in the HPI section, the check is satisfied. This is not a critical detail (it would not severely impact patient care if miscategorized), but it is present and properly categorized, which constitutes a pass.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States that daughter has removed rugs and has evaluate home for other safety hazards.",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the HPI states that the daughter has removed rugs and has evaluated the home for other safety hazards.

Throw rugs removed; items placed within easy reach; grab bar by toilet; plan to install shower grab bar. Considering adaptive equipment (reacher, sock aid).' This clearly documents that throw rugs have been removed and that home safety modifications have been made (items within reach, grab bars, etc.), indicating evaluation for safety hazards. The detail is present in the HPI section where it should be. This is not a critical detail (it's important for discharge planning but not a critical safety issue like allergies or substance use that would severely impact immediate patient care if miscategorized). The information is correctly placed in the HPI section.",HPI
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In HPI, States patient has stairs at home",Pass,High,"The check asks whether the HPI states that the patient has stairs at home. Examining the HPI section, I find the following relevant passage: 'Functional status: Requires moderate assist for upper body dressing (unable to manage bra); needs some assist for lower body dressing due to balance and back pain; needs assistance with bathing; uses shower chair; fearful of falling. Toilet use OK with caution. Sleeping in recliner, unable to lie flat comfortably. Difficulty with stairs to bedroom; holds railing tightly.' This clearly documents that the patient has difficulty with stairs to the bedroom and holds the railing tightly, which indicates stairs are present at home. Additionally, the Social History section states 'Lives alone at home; stairs to bedroom.' The detail about stairs at home is present in the HPI section. This is not a critical detail (it's a home safety/environmental factor, not an allergy or substance use issue), so even if it were in a different section, it would still pass. However, it is appropriately placed in the HPI where functional limitations related to the home environment are discussed. The check is satisfied.",HPI

The note does mention that she lives alone and that her children (daughter and son) are providing assistance. However, the phrasing is slightly different - the note says they are 'providing assistance initially post-discharge' rather than explicitly stating they 'live close and willing to help.' That said, the essential information is present: (1) patient lives alone, and (2) her children are willing/able to help. The detail about them living 'close' is not explicitly stated, but the core concept that children are available and willing to assist is clearly documented in the Social History section.

These are NOT labs, diagnostics, or imaging orders—they are rehabilitation/therapy services. True labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered would include things like blood work, imaging studies, or diagnostic procedures. The section appears to be mislabeled or misused, as it contains therapy plans rather than actual diagnostic orders. However, the check states 'N/A', which is accurate—there are no actual labs, diagnostics, or imaging studies being ordered in this note.

Looking at the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section in the SOAP note, it includes: follow up with outpatient OT/PT for 'continued ADL retraining, strengthening, balance, gait, and stair training' and 'Continue daily inpatient therapy until discharge as per team plan.' The section explicitly mentions 'strengthening' which directly addresses strength work. Additionally, the Assessment section notes 'decreased strength, ROM, balance, and endurance' as problems being addressed through therapy. While the exact phrase 'strength and endurance' is not stated verbatim in the Health maintenance section, the concept is clearly present through references to 'strengthening' and the therapy plan addresses both strength and endurance through the prescribed OT/PT interventions. Since this is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation for ongoing therapy), and the substance of the recommendation is present even if not in the exact wording, this meets the criterion.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments, States patient to continue outpatient physical therapy at Fairchild Medical Center 2-3 days a week after she returns home",Pass,High,"The CHECK asks whether the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section states that the patient should continue outpatient physical therapy at Fairchild Medical Center 2-3 days a week after returning home. Examining the SOAP note's 'Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments' section, I find: 'Follow up with outpatient OT/PT at Fairchild Medical Center 2–3 times per week after discharge for continued ADL retraining, strengthening, balance, gait, and stair training.' This statement explicitly mentions outpatient physical therapy (PT) at Fairchild Medical Center at 2-3 times per week after discharge. The detail is present and correctly categorized in the appropriate section. This is not a critical detail (it's a recommendation for follow-up care, not a safety-critical detail like allergies or substance use), so even if it were miscategorized, it would pass. However, in this case, it is both present and correctly placed.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments
,,,,,,,,,custom_satisfies_statement,"In Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments, States patient to inform physical therapist if left shoulder pain increases to show ways to protect it",Fail,High,"The CHECK asks whether the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section states that the patient should inform the physical therapist if left shoulder pain increases to show ways to protect it. Looking at the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section in the SOAP note, it lists follow-up with outpatient OT/PT, continuation of inpatient therapy, family assistance, and coordination of therapy services. However, there is NO specific instruction for the patient to inform the physical therapist if left shoulder pain increases. The patient education section does mention 'Protect left shoulder from overuse; report increasing pain,' but this is a general instruction to report, not specifically directed to the physical therapist in the context of follow-up appointments. The specific detail requested in the CHECK—that the patient should inform the physical therapist if left shoulder pain increases to show ways to protect it—is not present in the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments section. While a similar concept appears in the Patient education section, the CHECK specifically asks about the Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments category. Since this is not a critical detail (it's clinical guidance rather than a safety-critical categorization issue like allergies or substance use), the standard would be that the detail must be present in the specified section to pass. The detail is not present in the specified section.",Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments

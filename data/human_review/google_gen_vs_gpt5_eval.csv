Patient to proceed with scheduled sleep study this upcoming Monday at Lebonheur East Surgery Center to evaluate for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.

States that patient was advised to continue current medications, including melatonin, without changes pending sleep study results.
States that patient was counseled on the potential for her primary care provider to evaluate the cause of her long-standing nocturia, as addressing it may improve sleep continuity.
States that patient was advised on deep breathing exercises to help manage racing thoughts when unable to sleep.

**Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments:**
States that patient is to follow up with her primary care provider to discuss management of her blood pressure and to seek evaluation for nocturia.

**Plan**

**Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered:**
Patient to proceed with scheduled sleep study this upcoming Monday at Lebonheur East Surgery Center to evaluate for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.
Provider will follow up with the sleep medicine clinic to ensure the referral for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is processed.

**Patient education:**
States that patient was counseled on the benefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) for addressing thought patterns that interfere with sleep.
States that patient was advised that hormone therapy is unlikely to be beneficial for her sleep symptoms given the length of time since her surgical menopause and lack of current vasomotor symptoms.
States that it was recommended patient continue with current sleep hygiene practices, including a consistent bedtime and avoiding screens before bed.
States that patient was advised to continue current medications, including melatonin, without changes pending sleep study results.
States that patient was counseled on the potential for her primary care provider to evaluate the cause of her long-standing nocturia, as addressing it may improve sleep continuity.
States that patient was advised on deep breathing exercises to help manage racing thoughts when unable to sleep.

**Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments:**
States that patient is to follow up with her primary care provider to discuss management of her blood pressure and to seek evaluation for nocturia.
States that patient is to follow up after sleep study results are available to discuss findings and further treatment options.",51.txt,2025-11-10 21:07:08.960144+00:00,allysalelliott@gmail.com,,Auto-eval review,satisfies_statement,"In Header, States patient’s last name as Bergemann",Pass,"In the Header section, it states 'States that patient is Ms. Bergemann,' indicating the patient's last name is Bergemann.

**Plan**

**Labs/diagnostics/imaging being ordered:**
Patient to proceed with scheduled sleep study this upcoming Monday at Lebonheur East Surgery Center to evaluate for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.
Provider will follow up with the sleep medicine clinic to ensure the referral for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is processed.

**Patient education:**
States that patient was counseled on the benefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) for addressing thought patterns that interfere with sleep.
States that patient was advised that hormone therapy is unlikely to be beneficial for her sleep symptoms given the length of time since her surgical menopause and lack of current vasomotor symptoms.
States that it was recommended patient continue with current sleep hygiene practices, including a consistent bedtime and avoiding screens before bed.
States that patient was advised to continue current medications, including melatonin, without changes pending sleep study results.
States that patient was counseled on the potential for her primary care provider to evaluate the cause of her long-standing nocturia, as addressing it may improve sleep continuity.
States that patient was advised on deep breathing exercises to help manage racing thoughts when unable to sleep.

**Health maintenance/Follow up Appointments:**
States that patient is to follow up with her primary care provider to discuss management of her blood pressure and to seek evaluation for nocturia.
States that patient is to follow up after sleep study results are available to discuss findings and further treatment options.",51.txt,2025-11-14 18:58:46.676951+00:00,kendalellenbeck@gmail.com,,Auto-eval review,satisfies_statement,"In Header, States patient’s last name as Bergemann",Pass,"In the Header section, it states 'States that patient is Ms. Bergemann,' indicating the patient's last name is Bergemann.

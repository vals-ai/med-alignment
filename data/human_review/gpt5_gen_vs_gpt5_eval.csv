Chief Complaint(s):
- Postoperative recovery after right total shoulder arthroplasty with difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs), especially dressing and bathing; concerns about balance and safety. Pain manageable (3–4/10).

HPI:
- 79-year-old female s/p right total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) a few days ago at Orange Regional Medical Center. Pain 3–4/10; using sling at all times; right upper extremity non-weight-bearing. Performing pendulum exercises and hand/finger exercises; anxious about movement.
- Functional status: Requires moderate assist for upper body dressing (unable to manage bra); needs some assist for lower body dressing due to balance and back pain; needs assistance with bathing; uses shower chair; fearful of falling. Toilet use OK with caution. Sleeping in recliner, unable to lie flat comfortably. Difficulty with stairs to bedroom; holds railing tightly.
- Therapy assessments: Occupational therapy AM-PAC ADL score 16/24 (threshold ≥18 typically indicates safer discharge home). Therapists note decreased strength, range of motion, balance, and endurance. Participating in daily inpatient therapy; outpatient OT 2–3x/week recommended after discharge; PT to address gait, balance, and stair training.
- Prior level of function: Previously completely independent with ADLs/IADLs; activities included gardening, occasional bowling, and occasional golf (limited recently by arthritis).
- Safety/home setup: Lives alone; daughter and son will alternate providing help initially (at least first 24 hours post-discharge). Throw rugs removed; items placed within easy reach; grab bar by toilet; plan to install shower grab bar. Considering adaptive equipment (reacher, sock aid).
- Assistive items: Wears glasses (no current vision problems with glasses). Partial dentures; difficulty cleaning dentures one-handed (uses towel to prevent dropping). Uses weekly pill organizer; opening pill bottles is difficult one-handed.
